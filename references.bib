  abstract = {Experiments are reported on the rf breakdown in two resonators of a re-entrant type and a partially concave waveguide along the axis in the frequency range of 0.8-0.9 GHz, concerning LHRH in tokamak plasma. Characteristics of the breakdown are significantly dependent on the uniformity of the rf field as well as the presence of initial electrons, but independent of the filling pressure of hydrogen gas below 10\^{$<$}-3{$>$} torr. The mechanism of breakdown is mainly reduced to the secondary electron resonance breakdown.},

The papers are expanded versions of the lectures delivered by the authors at the mini-course. Not all the lectures were submitted as papers for this issue. The papers in this issue, however, cover important aspects of all frequency regimes-from the lowest, Alfven wave frequencies, to the highest, electron cyclotron frequencies-in which there are currently intensive research activities in heating of magnetically confined plasmas for fusion energy generation. In the following we shall attempt to give an overview of this very active field of plasma electrodynamics research and put the contributions to this issue in perspective. For readers not actively engaged in this field we shall first give a brief orientation with references to reviews and most recently published conference proceedings where the up-to-date results are usually reported.},

  abstract = {Plasma heating of a Tokamak plasma by wave coupling in the ion cyclotron range of frequency has been investigated during the last decade along several schemes: in a two-ion plasma containing comparable amounts of the ion components, wave conversion heating is expected to couple the main part of the power to the electrons. For a small fraction of one of the two components, the power will be coupled by minority heating to the low density ion species. Heating of a single ion plasma requires power coupling at the second harmonic frequency. The theoretical basis for those three mechanisms is qualitatively reviewed. Wave conversion heating has been particularly investigated in the TFR Tokamak. The experimental results are reviewed underlining the important role played by metallic impurities on the evolution of ion and electron temperatures and the severe limitation on electron temperature observed in all conditions.},

  abstract = {On each of the Tore Supra ICRH antennas [1], 4 variable vacuum capacitors supplied by COMET* are used to match the antenna feed point impedance to the generator output impedance. On such a system, the whole transmission line is working near matched conditions, and high RF voltages are limited to the front part of the antenna. The quality, performance and reliability of the COMET capacitors, fixed or variable type, have been proved by thousands of units in operation in high power oscillators and amplifier circuits. The variable type (10 to 150 pF) fitted in Tore Supra antennas has allowed remarkable results. A record radiated power density of 1.6 kW/cm2, has been achieved, and RF peak voltages in excess of 40 kV are commonly used during plasma shots. However, by construction of the capacitor, a water cooled bellows on the RF current path limits the velocity of the capacitance variation. Reliable RF experiments during transients phenomena like pellet injection, monsters sawteeth or plasma displacements require the matching system to follow rapid variations of loads. Therefore, a new concept of variable vacuum capacitor allowing faster capacitance adjustment, is studied in collaboration with COMET. In this concept, the RF current flows through a sliding contact strip from PANTECHNIK+ working in the sealed vacuum. The RF current path is therefore dissociated from the vacuum barrier. Sliding contacts, both in vacuum conditions and handling high RF current are not in common use in the RF field and have to be tested. This paper describes the existing variable capacitor, the new capacitor concept, the RF contact test device as well as the experimental results.},

  abstract = {Recently, a new recipe for developing and deploying real-time systems has become increasingly adopted in the JET tokamak. Powered by the advent of x86 multi-core technology and the reliability of JET's well established Real-Time Data Network (RTDN) to handle all real-time I/O, an official Linux vanilla kernel has been demonstrated to be able to provide real-time performance to user-space applications that are required to meet stringent timing constraints. In particular, a careful rearrangement of the Interrupt ReQuests' (IRQs) affinities together with the kernel's CPU isolation mechanism allows one to obtain either soft or hard real-time behavior depending on the synchronization mechanism adopted. Finally, the Multithreaded Application Real-Time executor (MARTe) framework is used for building applications particularly optimised for exploring multi-core architectures. In the past year, four new systems based on this philosophy have been installed and are now part of JET's routine operation. The focus of the present work is on the configuration aspects that enable these new systems' real-time capability. Details are given about the common real-time configuration of these systems, followed by a brief description of each system together with results regarding their real-time performance. A cycle time jitter analysis of a user-space MARTe based application synchronizing over a network is also presented. The goal is to compare its deterministic performance while running on a vanilla and on a Messaging Real time Grid (MRG) Linux kernel.},

  abstract = {During ion cyclotron resonance heating, the sheath power dissipation caused by ion acceleration in the radio frequency (RF) sheath is one of the main causes of RF power loss in the tokamak edge region. To estimate the power dissipation of an RF sheath in the ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF), a 1D fluid model for the multi-component plasma sheath driven by a sinusoidal disturbance current in the ICRF is presented. By investigation of the sheath potential and ion flux at the wall, it is shown that the larger frequency and lower amplitude of the disturbance current can cause smaller sheath power dissipation. The effect of the energetic ion on the sheath power dissipation depends on the disturbance current. For large amplitude of disturbance current, the increase in the concentration and energy of the energetic ion leads to a decrease in sheath power dissipation. While for a small disturbance current, the sheath power dissipation demonstrates non-monotonic variation with the concentration and energy of the energetic ion. In addition, the sheath power dissipation is found to have a small increase in the presence of light impurity ions with low valence.},

This prototype has been recently validated in Tore Supra plasmas exhibiting fast density perturbations in front of the antenna. This paper reports on the load resilience properties of the antenna prototype, as well as the RF modeling and the commissioning.

These RF contacts will be integrated into the antenna structure at different locations to facilitate the assembly and decouple the different mechanical parts. This design will in addition lower the thermo-mechanical constraints and allow radial shimming of the antenna front face. As commercial contacts were not suitable for the ITER ICRH antenna operation, substantial efforts have been made on mechanical design of the new RF contact. Two prototypes have been manufactured and delivered to CEA for testing. In parallel a test stand facility (TITAN) has been refurbished to provide a way to test these RF contacts in relevant conditions (2.25kA @ 62.5MHz, vacuum pressure {$<$}10-3Pa, 1000s). This paper reports on main results we get during the commissioning of the test stand facility. Roadmap of the tests is also detailed with RF power tests for long shot duration (1000s) under vacuum and extensive sliding tests in order to assess the reliability of the RF contact for a relevant life time duration (specified to 10 years). A description of the RF contact is also given with the latest results on the manufacturing process (copper and gold plating and brazing, general assembly).},

  abstract = {A rigorous field theory method is described for the computer-aided design of a class of rectangular waveguide filters, where the cavities are coupled by irises, \textsterling -plane integrated metal inserts, broadside oriented strip obstacles, or multiple quadratic posts. These coupling elements enable low-cost manufacturing, since accurate and inexpensive metal-etching techniques, or materials with standard dimensions may be utilised. The design method is based on field expansion in suitably normalised eigenmodes which yield directly the modal scattering matrix of two appropriate key building blocks for this kind of filter, the step-wall discontinuity and the N-furcated waveguide section of finite length. The theory includes the finite thickness of the diaphragms, strips or posts as well as the immediate higher-order mode interaction of all discontinuities. The stop-band characteristic of the filter is taken into account in the optimisation process. Optimised data are given for Ku-, E-, W-, and D-band filter examples, whereby it is shown that the theory is also very appropriate for broadband designs. The theory is verified by measured results for a six resonator iris coupled Ku-band filter, with a midband frequency of 15.2 GHz and a seven-resonator metal insert D-band filter, with a midband frequency of 142.5 GHz, snowing measured minimum insertion losses of 0.2 dB and 1.4 dB, respectively.},

The efficiency and flexibility of the hybrid CAD method is demonstrated at advanced EM design examples, such as broad-band circular-to-rectangular waveguide transitions including octagonal cross sections, waveguide resonator filters with rounded corners, optimum-shaped bends, dual-mode filters with coupling sections without tuning screws, ridged waveguide filters with rounded corners, and multiplexers. The designed components are directly amenable to cost-efficient fabrication techniques like computer-controlled milling methods. The theory is verified by available measurements.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the application of a projective geometry tool known as conformal geometric algebra (CGA) to transmission line theory. Explicit relationships between the Smith Chart, Riemann Sphere, and CGA are developed to illustrate the evolution of projective geometry in transmission line theory. By using CGA, fundamental network operations, such as adding impedance, admittance, and changing lines impedance can be implemented with rotations, and are shown to form a group. In addition, the transformations relating different circuit representations, such as impedance, admittance, and reflection coefficient are also related by rotations. Thus, the majority of relationships in transmission line theory are linearized. Conventional transmission line formulas are replaced with an operator-based framework. Use of the framework is demonstrated by analyzing the distributed element model and solving some impedance matching problems.},

This thesis explores issues related to breakdown in the Transcom TC2571 PHEMT, and the effects this has on the Draper Laboratory 2.3 GHz microwave power amplifier in which the transistor is used. Characterization of breakdown was performed under DC and RF drive conditions, and shows the surprising role of impact ionization at low temperatures in DC offstate breakdown, as well as the apparent prevalence of on-state breakdown under RF drive. DC characterization shows that breakdown walkout and recovery both proceed more quickly at higher temperatures, and also shows that breakdown stress might lead to the permanent creation of traps that degrade breakdown voltage. Walkout under RF drive decreases amplifier gain at lower levels of RF input drive, but appears to have no negative effect on amplifier saturated output power. The use of temperaturecompensated input drive and a diode to clamp negative gate voltage swing are also explored as circuit design techniques that can mitigate device degradation due to breakdown stress.},

ICRF antenna is presently situated in a port of limited size in the vacuum vessel (VV), which may be accompanied with operational limitations in DEMO, primarily because such configurations present high power density structures that can undergo malfunctions for the power levels anticipated for DEMO, because of voltage stand-off limitations. To mitigate this, a novel ICRF antenna is under development and consists of toroidally distributed identical radiating straps integrated inside the blanket First Wall. Given the antenna concept novelty and the strict requirements on the performance of DEMO, substantial design and integration efforts are needed.

A 5.0-GHz microwave coupler is designed for KSTAR LHCD experiments. Four high-power klystrons feed 128 guidelets at front coupler using hundred and twenty 3-dB power dividers including 3-dB power splitters in the coupler. The guidelet has a height of 5.5 cm and the width of 0.55 cm in order for the power flux density not to exceed 4.0 kW/cm2 at the guidelet. The coupler is constructed by laminating a stack of metal plates milled to waveguide patterns. This paper describes detailed design for the 3-dB power splitter, the fixed-phase shifter, and the taper section composing the coupler.

By careful design of the input waveguide either a relatively pure TElO or a combination of TE10 and higher modes may be launched into a 3 m long overmoded test section of the system. The overmoded section is terminated in a matched load. The wavaguide will support T E \textasciitilde{} mO odes where n is any odd integer between 1 and 13. Even-order modes are normally suppressed, if they arise at all, by a longitudinal slot along the centre of one of the broad faces of the waveguide. Electric field amplitude and phase profiles within the overmoded waveguide are measured continuously, either transversely or longitudinally. The mathematical techniques required to determine higher-order mode content from the field profiles within the waveguide are considered. The ill-conditioning problems that arise when an attempt is made to solve conventionally a system of linear simultaneous equations are avoided by using a Fourier technique. By considering a simple launching profile such as an abrupt boundary enlargement, the higher-order mode content of the waveguide is calculated. Experimental measurements of the field within the waveguide enable mode content to be determined for comparison with the theoretical data. In this way the amplitudes and phases of the higher-order propagating modes are determined.},

It also plays an important role in the triggering of the multipactor phenomenon occurring in waveguides (electron avalanche in microwave electric fields). In this paper, we propose an original method adapted to low-energy SEE measurements on dielectrics and conductors (incident electron energy below 20 eV). It is based on Kelvin probe (KP) surface potential measurements after electron irradiation. It is particularly well suited to insulating materials but can also be used on metals by letting the sample potential float. We present results of SEE measurements performed on metals used in waveguides, Kapton, Teflon, and CMX cover glass. In order to avoid any experimental artifact due to the earth magnetic field and conduct accurate low-energy measurements with the KP method, the distance between the electron gun and the sample is chosen to be negligible compared to the Larmor radius.},

In this work, a systematic study of measured fusion cross-sections is performed to determine which reactions are potentially feasible and identify the fuel cycle that maximizes specific energy. This reveals that, by using normal hydrogen to breed deuterium via neutron capture, the conventional catalyzed D-D fusion fuel cycle can attain a specific energy greater than anything else. Simply surrounding a catalyzed D-D reactor with water enables deuterium fuel, the dominant stockpile of energy on Earth, to produce as much as 65\% more energy. Lastly, the impact on space propulsion is considered, revealing that an effective exhaust velocity exceeding that of deuterium-helium-3 is theoretically possible.},

Excited by a single-frequency point source, this metamaterial exhibits conical high-field regions called ``resonance cones'' which extend outward from the source in directions predetermined by the load reactances, thus carrying RF power to specific points on the resistively terminated network edges. When two such metamaterials are interfaced, the cones traversing the interface can exhibit negative refraction as well as subwavelength focusing, phenomena supported by physical experiments and corresponding moment-method simulations. Poynting vector calculations based on the simulation data reveal power flow that follows the cones smoothly from the source and across the refraction interface. Electromagnetic field and Poynting vector calculations both exhibit potentially significant differences depending on whether they are done at the ground plane level or at the level of the anisotropic grid.},

In this procedure, screens of large extent with complex but periodic geometry are replaced during the FEM simulation by sheets representing anisotropic impedance boundary conditions. The homogenized anisotropic impedance boundary conditions are calculated from a single unit cell of the screen by using the finite element method. The FEM is modified to handle the new anisotropic impedance boundary condition. Replacing large screens with an impedance boundary condition reduces the size of the finite element mesh and allows more complex structures to be simulated. While the procedure is approximate, it does provide good accuracy to determine levels of EMC/EMI radiation in complex electronic equipment. The method is applied to compute the radiation emanating from a real-life electronic printed circuit board enclosed in a real-life computer cabinet.},

The WEST project aims to test ITER-like W monoblock Plasma Facing Units (PFU). This ITER-like divertor will be tested under long plasma discharge up to 1000 s, with high heat flux density up to 20 MW/m2. This paper presents the results of ANSYS thermal-structural simulations of the WEST upper divertor. The upper divertor is made of twelve 30{$\smwhtcircle$} sectors, each one composed of 38 PFU. The PFUs are actively cooled CuCrZr heat sinks and the incidence surface is coated with a thin tungsten layer. The fixing system is made of pins engaged in slotted holes. Besides, the fixing system of the sector assembly is the same as WEST lower divertor, so one upper divertor sector can be used indifferently in upper or Lower position during transitional operation phases in WEST. The total surface of the upper divertor is 8 m2, and it has to be able to extract up to 4 MW in steady-state, with peak heat flux values up to 8 MW/m2. The fixing system was designed to handle structural loads such as forces and torques resulting from halo and eddy current, respectively, especially during disruptions and Vertical Displacement Event (VDE). The torque resulting from eddy current is first calculated thanks to an internal CEA ANSYS APDL routine. Then the ANSYS structural and thermal-structural simulations of the PFU are presented, and its design is validated thanks to A-level RCC-MRx criteria. Finally, the most conservative load case is determined in order to validate the design of the pins and the support structure.},

This criterion is applied to two dispersive models: negative index metamaterials and uniaxial anisotropic plasmas. In both cases, classical PMLs are unstable but the criterion allows us to design new stable PMLs. Numerical simulations illustrate our purpose.},

One of the next decade's scientific challenges consists of merging the scientific knowledge accumulated during the past 40 years into a reliable set of validated simulation tools, accessible and useful for ITER prediction and interpretation activity, as well as for the conceptual design of the future reactors. Obviously such simulators involve a high degree of ``integration'' in several respects: integration of multi-space, multi-scale (time and space) physics, integration of physics and technology models, inter-discipline integration etc. This very distinctive feature, in the framework of a rather long term and world-wide activity, constrains strongly the choices to be made at all levels of developments. A European task force on integrated tokamak modelling has been activated with the long-term aim of providing the EU with a set of codes necessary for preparing and analysing future ITER discharges, with the highest degree of flexibility and reliability. In parallel with the development of simulation tools and software environment, the long term evolution of hardware needs is also discussed at several levels (EU, EU\textendash Japan broader approach, high performance computing, grid technology, data access, etc.), and progress in this domain is reported. Finally, the ITM task force is also working out the worldwide compatibility through regular collaboration with the similar integrated modelling structures which already exist or are being put in place by the other ITER partners.},

This technique is able to compute, not only the modal spectra at the free ports of the global network, but also the modal spectra at the connected ports, so that the field inside the full network can be computed for an arbitrary incidence. In addition, this technique can also be used to evaluate the scattering parameters of the global network.},

  abstract = {Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) has been demonstrated to be an important actuator for controlling the current profiles of advanced tokamak plasmas, either in fully non-inductive or in hybrid regimes. To continue such scenario development in JET, and most notably towards extrapolations for ITER, an upgrade of its LH launcher is required to deliver more power ({$>$}5 MW) and to deal with a broad array of density situations at the plasma edge more consistently. These may range from steep gradients to ELM activity; extend from as low as the cut-off density nec to large and fast density variations and give rise to strong and rapid reflections of RF power. The passive active multijunction (PAM), advocated as the LH launcher concept for ITER, is claimed to be more resilient to such conditions, run with increased efficiency near nec and even with a small vacuum gap, being also specially appropriate for long pulse operation\textemdash all conditions hampering traditional designs. In addition, some of this leverage has been confirmed experimentally at the ITER-relevant FTU with the first PAM ever deployed, and more recently with Tore Supra's PAM. The JET version addressed in this study, with the latter focusing on the physics that drives and supports the adopted technical solutions, allows the injection of up to 5.2 MW at 3.7 GHz and N||peak = 1.9. With directivities better than 70\%, reflection coefficients below 2\% even for {$\sim$}nec and power densities comparable to those foreseen for ITER at 5 GHz, it would validate this concept in ITER-relevant scenarios.},

The fretting tests are conducted using a traditional bench, and a new structure made of cross cylinders is adapted for transmitting RF signal in the frequency range [10 MHz-10 GHz]. The structure is also designed to inject simultaneously DC current and RF signal. The corresponding electrical contact resistances are continuously measured during the test. DC and RF resistance evaluate qualitatively in the same way but with different magnitudes. RF resistance has a high value, which is due to the skin effect in high frequency. It is important to perform simultaneous DC and RF measurements because results may be very dispersive for each test and could prevent us from comparing them.},

Based on the experience acquired in Tore Supra, the ICRH system has been upgraded for long pulse operation and Edge Localized Modes (ELM) resilience. To achieve this performance, three antennas have been designed through a European collaboration and are now under fabrication at CAS/ASIPP, at the Keye Company, Hefei, in China, within the framework of the Associated Laboratory IRFM-ASIPP. This paper describes the electrical and mechanical design of the antenna, together with the main manufacturing steps and leak test procedure used for validating the water-cooled components.

The klystron is equipped with a diode gun, a five-cavity RF structure, two BeO-disk RF windows, and a large-size X-ray-shielded hypervapotron collector. The output power is recombined in a four-port junction which we also developed. The tube is designed to deliver 620-kW CW RF power with a mismatched load (VSWR = 1.4) and 700-kW CW with a matched load. Several prototypes have been built with successive design improvements. The major improvement was to change one single RF output into two RF outputs. The most recently built prototype meets all design specifications at 73.1 kV and 20.7 A, with an efficiency of 47\% on a matched load and 40\% with a 1.4 : 1 VSWR load, worst case phase. The power losses dissipated in the body have been measured as low as 17 kW, which corresponds to the RF heating and implies low beam interception. The measured temperatures of the output cavity noses and collector wall have been kept below 130 {$\smwhtcircle$}C and 200 {$\smwhtcircle$}C, respectively, which results in large thermal margin.},

Using spectral analysis and linear vector space theory it is found that for a given number of basis functions, there exists a minimum number of expansion modes required for a reasonable accuracy. Subsequently, for a given number of expansion modes, there is an upper limit for the number of basis functions. The mode matching (MM) analysis is viewed as a special case of the MoM analysis and the accuracy of the analysis is discussed with respect to the number of modes in the waveguides.},

  abstract = {A new concept -the reflector waveguide array -is proposed to improve and simplify the design of continuous wave lower hybrid (LH) launchers for steady state reactor applications. Mechanical robustness of the antenna and efficient heat removal are provided by a thick wall waveguide structure that can accommodate a large number of cooling ducts. The plasma facing mouthpiece could be made of the same material as the reactor first wall and could be easily replaceable through remote handling. In order to compensate for the increased horizontal distance between adjacent waveguides, the front ends of the thick septa are grooved to form short (''X/4) passive waveguides that act as reflectors between the radiofrequency powered waveguides (drivers). Then, for an adequate phasing between the active waveguides, the total electric field at the reflector waveguide apertures varies coherently with the one in the drivers to launch a highly directional slow wave. It is shown that the coupling properties of such an array and the directivity of the radiated power spectrum are similar to those of present day launchers. Their dependences upon the depth of the reflector waveguides, and the electron density and its gradient are investigated. The effect of changing the phase between the drivers is also studied. The proposed reflector LH antenna would provide enough flexibility to vary the N11 spectrum for plasma control purposes in a steady state fusion reactor.},

The reliability of LH for long pulse operation has been ascertained on Tore Supra.

The key parts of the tokamak assembly building and the tokamak bioshield have been completed. The tokamak building itself will be ready for equipment in 2020. The cryogenic plant and the magnet power supply buildings are complete, and these systems begin commissioning in 2019. The power conversion and distribution area is complete and the component cooling water system building has started construction. Manufacturing of the basic components of the ITER tokamak is also proceeding well. The base and lower cylinder of the cryostat have been assembled on the ITER site. The first modules of the central solenoid and of the six poloidal field coils have been wound. The first winding packs of the toroidal field magnets are complete, as are the first casings, which have been verified to meet the high tolerances required. The first vacuum vessel sector is near completion and demonstrated to meet strict tolerances. The Heating and Current Drive systems (NB, ECH and ICH) are in the final design phase. The sequence of complementary ITER operation from First Plasma (FP) to the achievement of the Q = 10 and Q = 5 project goals has been adapted to the Staged Approach to construction, a stepwise installation of all systems. The ITER Research Plan has been revised in 2017 to be consistent with the systems available in each phase. Physics studies focus on the Disruption Mitigation System, design of the ITER tungsten divertor, and modelling of ITER plasma scenarios. Modelling concentrates on the initial phases of the Research Plan and on the Q = 10 scenario, especially plasma termination.},

In these experiments the wave spectrum excited by the generator and the antenna is normally coherent so that the standard justification of the QL theory, namely that particles interact with a random phase ensemble of waves, cannot be applied. The QL theory is, nevertheless, valid provided that the wave phase seen by nearly resonant particles is effectively randomized before the nonlinearity of the particle motion in the wave starts to become important. In the case of Landau resonances at frequencies in the ion cyclotron range or below, when electrons normally resonate with only one wave at a time, the main randomization mechanism is due to Coulomb collisions. A numerical technique to evaluate the diffusion coefficient of the standard map, due to Rechester et al (1981 Phys. Rev. A 23 2264), has been extended to take into account weak collisions. It allows an efficient and accurate evaluation of the velocity diffusion coefficient as a function of collisionality and wave amplitude, and, in particular, leads to an explicit quantitative criterion for the transition from the nonlinear to the QL regime.},

  abstract = {A phase-controlled lower hybrid wave (LHW) multi-junction (MJ) coupler (3(rows)\texttimes 4(columns)\texttimes 4 (subwaveguides)) has been developed in the HT-7 tokamak. Simulations show that it is more effective for driving plasma current than an ordinary phase-controlled LHW antenna (3(rows)\texttimes{} 12(columns)) (traditional coupler). The plasma\textendash wave coupling experiments show that the reflection coefficient (RC) is below 10\%, implying that the MJ grill can launch the wave into the plasma effectively. The effect of power spectrum launched by the MJ coupler on RC indicates that an optimal condition is requisite for a better coupling in the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) experiments. Studies indicate that the drive efficiency of the MJ antenna is higher than that of the traditional one, which is mainly ascribed to the discrepancy in impurity concentration, plasma temperature, and spectrum directivity. An improved confinement with an electron internal transport barrier is obtained by LHCD. The analysis shows that the modified negative (low) magnetic shear and the change of radial electric field profile due to LHCD are possible factors responsible for the eITB formation.},

  abstract = {Entanglement and (de-)coherence arguably define the central issues of concern in present day quantum information theory. Entanglement being a consequence of the quantum mechanical superposition principle for composite systems, a better understanding of the environment-induced destruction of coherent superposition states is required to devise novel strategies for harvesting quantum interference phenomena. The present book collects a series of advanced lectures on the theoretical foundations of this active research field, from mathematical aspects underlying quantum topology to mesoscopic transport theory. All lectures start out from an elementary level and proceed along a steep learning curve. This makes the material particularly suitable for student seminars on the more fundamental theoretical aspects of quantum information, and equally useful as supplementary reading for advanced lectures on this topic.},

Swain, in: 14th Topical Conference on Radiofrequency Power in Plasmas, Oxnard 2001, AIP Conference Proceedings 595, AIP, Melville, NY, 2001, p. 510] has been implemented to study voltage stand-off of the ICRF antennas on ASDEX Upgrade (AUG). The probe was operated at first in a test stand where features of high RF voltage operation in vacuum and plasma created by an ion source of the Hall type [Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 8 (1999) R1] were studied. Vacuum arcs as well as ignition of high voltage glow discharge are candidate processes to explain voltage limits of the ICRF antennas. The setup on AUG was used to expose high RF voltages in real conditions of the tokamak scrape-off layer which are faced by the ICRF antennas. It is found that high voltage breakdown on the ICRF antenna is often correlated with ELM activity. The maximal RF voltage increased from shot to shot, i.e. the conditioning effect is observed. For the good-conditioned ICRF probe it was shown experimentally that the voltage limit can be increased while the rectified current is suppressed at the same time.},

Together with the contribution from the other limiter tiles, not replaced in 2012, the limiters account for at least two thirds of the W content. A modified test two-strap ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) antennas in ASDEX Upgrade with broad limiters and narrow straps has shown an improved operation with full W wall in 2011/2012 campaigns with up to a 40\% lower rise of W concentration allowing more stable operation at low deuterium gas injection rate. Limiter spectroscopy measurements indicate up to a 40\% reduction of the rise of the W sputtering yield during ICRF power, measured under the assumption of negligible influence of geometry variations and reflections on the measurements. The boron limiters on two antennas together with the improved broad-limiter antenna allowed a successful ICRF operation in 2012. As a part of long-term strategy of antenna design development, two three-strap antennas with phase and power balance control for reduction of E|| are planned for installation in the future.},

The comparison substantiates a reduction of the local electric field at the radially protruding plasma-facing elements of the antenna as a relevant approach for minimizing tungsten (W) sputtering in conditions when the slow wave is strongly evanescent. The measured reaction of the time-averaged RF current at the antenna limiters to the antenna feeding variations is less sensitive than predicted by the calculations. This is likely to have been caused by temporal and spatial fluctuations in the 3D plasma density distribution affected by local non-linear interactions. The 3-strap antenna with the W-coated limiters produces drastically less W sputtering compared to the W-coated 2-strap antennas. This is consistent with the non-linear asymptotic SSWICH-SW calculations for RF sheaths.},

The reduction is observed with a broad range of plasma shapes. In multiple locations of antenna frame, the limiter W source has a minimum when RF image currents are decreased by cancellation of the RF current contributions of the central and the outer straps. In JET with ITER-like wall, ITER-like antenna produces about 20\% less of main chamber radiation and of W content compared to the old A2 antennas, although the effect of the A2 antennas on W content is scattered depending on which antennas are powered. Experiments in JET with trace nitrogen (N2) injection show that a presence of active ICRF antenna close to the midplane injection valve has little effect on the core N content, both in dipole and in -90\textdegree{} phasing. This indicates that the effect of ICRF on impurity transport across the scape-off-layer is small in JET compared to the dominant effect on impurity sources leading to increased impurity levels during ICRF operation.},

  abstract = {Recent achievements in studies of the effects of ICRF (Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies) power on the SOL (Scrape-Off Layer) and PWI (Plasma Wall Interactions) in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), Alcator C-Mod, and JET-ILW are reviewed. Capabilities to diagnose and model the effect of DC biasing and associated impurity production at active antennas and on magnetic field connections to antennas are described. The experiments show that ICRF near-fields can lead not only to E \texttimes{} B convection, but also to modifications of the SOL density, which for Alcator C-Mod are limited to a narrow region near antenna. On the other hand, the SOL density distribution along with impurity sources can be tailored using local gas injection in AUG and JET-ILW with a positive effect on reduction of impurity sources. The technique of RF image current cancellation at antenna limiters was successfully applied in AUG using the 3-strap AUG antenna and extended to the 4-strap Alcator C-Mod field-aligned antenna. Multiple observations confirmed the reduction of the impact of ICRF on the SOL and on total impurity production when the ratio of the power of the central straps to the total antenna power is in the range 0.6 {$<$} Pcen/ Ptotal{$<$} 0.8. Near-field calculations indicate that this fairly robust technique can be applied to the ITER ICRF antenna, enabling the mode of operation with reduced PWI. On the contrary, for the A2 antenna in JET-ILW the technique is hindered by RF sheaths excited at the antenna septum. Thus, in order to reduce the effect of ICRF power on PWI in a future fusion reactor, the antenna design has to be optimized along with design of plasmafacing components.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the results of a benchmark exercise in which the predictions of several simulation models for lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) were compared using parameters typical of the steady state operating scenario in the ITER device (the so-called Scenario 4). The most complete LHCD simulation models that were used combined 2D velocity space Fokker Planck solvers with toroidal ray tracing packages. These models also predicted the highest LHCD efficiencies with 2.0 \textendash{} 2.6 MA of driven current for 30 MW of coupled LHRF power. Codes that solved the Fokker Planck equation using a Green's function approach and then computed the driven LH current using a wave induced RF flux based on 1D parallel velocity damping along ray trajectories were found to predict LH currents 35-40\% lower than the 2D Fokker Planck models. This discrepancy is understood in terms of the approximate nature of the 1D wave induced flux that fails to properly capture 2D velocity space effects that occur in LHCD owing to the significant distortion of the electron distribution function. We also used an orbit-following Monte Carlo code to study the possible parasitic damping of LH waves on fusion generated alpha particles. The effect of magnetic field ripple and fast ion anomalous transport on the alpha population was considered. It was found that for a large anomalous diffusion coefficient (1m2/s), the absorption on fusion alphas can be as high as 7.7\% using a LHRF source frequency of 3.7 GHz. This result gives some confidence in the source frequency choice of 5.0 GHz in order to minimize the possibility of this parasitic interaction.},

The tokamak plasma density versus the abscissa entering the plasma is assumed to behave like a step and a subsequent ramp. The study is performed by means of a two-dimensional formulation employing cylindrical waves. A detailed numerical analysis is presented, which allows us to show results for different configurations useful in practical cases and comparisons with the constant-density case.},

  abstract = {In 2015, the optimized stellarator Wendelstein 7-X stellarator (W7-X) started with operation. The main objective of W7-X is the demonstration of the integrated reactor potential of the optimized stellarator line. An important element of this mission is the achievement of high heating power and high confinement in the steady-state operation. The approach to this mission is the following three steps. First, plasmas were produced in a limiter configuration [operation phase (OP 1.1)], then a test divertor unit is being installed (temporary divertor unit) for the next campaign, OP 1.2, before the full steady-state capability will be achieved implementing active cooling of all in-vessel components and a steady-state high heat-flux divertor. In December 2015, the first helium plasma was generated using electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), in February 2016, the working gas was switched to hydrogen. The first OP (OP 1.1) was successfully finished in March 2016. At the end of OP 1.1, the discharge duration was close to 6 s, the limit for the integrated heating power was increased to 4 MJ and electron temperatures of {$\sim$}10 keV were achieved. Due to the low densities in the range of 1019 cm-3 and the pure electron heating by ECRH, the ion temperatures reached only 2 keV. At present, W7-X is undergoing the next completion phase, including the installation of the test divertor unit, the installation of the carbon tiles on the inner plasma vessel wall, an upgrade of existing diagnostics, and the installation of new diagnostics. This paper discusses the first operational phase, lessons learned and implemented, and the status before the start of the second OP (OP 1.2).},

In this method, the complex impedance of each radiating element (Zs) is continuously measured in real time and, during the process of arc extinction, the arc position and complex admittance Ya continuously measured. An load independent arc alarm signal is generated and used to initiate and terminate the suppression routine.},

Both measurements indicate that, on the average, about a fraction of 1\% of the incident power is absorbed by the thin films, even though the local absorption coefficient may reach 50\%. Discontinuous surface films, where the surface contaminants have a patchy or island structure, are modeled with an equivalent transmission line circuit. The discontinuous film model is also applied to alumina windows with TiN coatings, and the results are compared with the continuous film model.},

The present paper starts with an analytical formula derived by J. A. Greenwood to find the electrical resistance of a cluster of perfect circular microcontacts. It is first shown that Greenwood's formula can be used to derive known and new formulas for the constriction resistance of single spots of various shapes. Then we consider the case where the microcontacts are not perfect, and characterize each microcontact by a film resistance. To generalize Greenwood's formula, we use an intermediate expression derived by this author, and substitute for the constriction resistance term of each spot, a term comprising the constriction resistance and the film resistance. We then test the formulas proposed in the paper. In all situations the electrical contact area is modeled by means of a set of square spots. At first, we consider experimental results concerning long rectangular spots. Then, we consider numerical results concerning square ring-shaped spots. And lastly, we consider the case where two large electrodes communicate through two concentric thin flat rings of variable conductivity. The contact resistance is then calculated using Greenwood's generalized formula and by means of the finite-element method. All tests are passed satisfactorily.},

  abstract = {The coupling efficiency of a phased multi-waveguide structure (the ``Grill'') designed to launch HF-waves at the lower hybrid resonance to heat large toroidal plasmas, while satisfying the accessibility condition, is studied. To find the reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as the k{$\Vert$}-spectrum of the excited field, the waveguide field, represented as a superposition of eigenmodes, is matched to the field in the plasma, which is evaluated on the assumption of a linear density profile near the plasma edge. It is found that the reflection coefficient can be made acceptably low and is not sensitively dependent on the plasma parameters. It is concluded that it is possible to design a Grill capable to launch lower hybrid waves at the power level required for the ignition of a reactor plasma.},

  abstract = {The role of electron Landau damping (ELD) in the lower hybrid resonance region is reviewed. First, it is shown that good matching of waves with parallel index n{$\parallel$} large enough for efficient ELD from a finite-length antenna is possible only if the antenna is facing a tenuous plasma such that . This situation appears to prevail in recent experiments using phased waveguide arrays as launching structures. Moreover, it is shown that the relevant portion of the spectrum will be depleted by linear wave transformation before suffering appreciable ELD, unless the frequency is at least 1.5 times higher than the resonant frequency in the core of the plasma. Thus, in the case of a phased waveguide array designed for efficient ion heating in the resonance region, hardly more than a few per cent of the power will be absorbed by the electrons through ELD. On the other hand, provided that the antenna design is appropriate, ELD itself can be regarded as a simple and efficient method of heating large plasmas up to thermonuclear temperatures.},

It is found that the reflection coefficient of the antenna and the fraction of power radiated in the `inaccessible' portion of the parallel-wavenumber spectrum remain essentially the same as those predicted by the simplified theory considering only the slow plasma wave. The most important new feature is that the power radiated in this part of the spectrum is mainly coupled to discrete waveguide-like eigenmodes confined to the outer layers of the plasma, which guide the power away from the antenna in the direction parallel to the wall of the chamber. This fraction of the power is likely to be lost from the point of view of the heating efficiency; therefore, one should make it as small as possible by using arrays of four guides or more.},

The wave equation is solved explicitly in two cases of physical interest: near an isolated two-ion hybrid resonance, where the fast wave couples to the cold torsional Alfven wave, leading mainly to electron heating; and near the first harmonic resonance of a single species plasma, where it couples to an ion Bernstein wave. These solutions clarify some aspects of the physics of these resonances, and can be useful for applications in numerical ICR heating codes.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes a theoretical model of coupling of ion Bernstein (IB) waves to tokamak plasmas using phased waveguides. To describe the propagation of these waves near higher harmonics of the ion cyclotron frequency, a set of differential wave equations is used, constructed by analogy to the familiar finite Larmor radius wave equations, but in such a way that its three independent WKB solutions correspond to the two cold plasma waves and the Bernstein wave to all orders in the ion Larmor radius. This system has a meaningful energy theorem and unambiguous boundary conditions at the plasma edge. It is integrated numerically to obtain the surface admittance matrix of the plasma. The efficiency of waveguide launching is evaluated by extending the theory developed for lower hybrid (LH) wave grills to take into account the finite height of the waveguides as well as the coupling between TE and TM modes at the waveguide mouths due to the fact that at these frequencies the admittance matrix is not diagonal. If the density at the plasma edge is sufficiently low, in particular well below the LH resonance density, results similar to those predicted by the cold plasma approximation are obtained. In this situation, low reflection coefficients in the waveguides can be achieved with antisymmetric excitation. Excitation of IB waves, however, occurs via mode transformation near the LH resonance layer, typically a few centimetres away from the antenna. Whether this is possible without energy losses cannot be investigated with the present model. As the density increases, the plasma surface becomes very reflective for waves with the ordinary polarization. As a consequence, direct linear coupling to IB waves by raising the edge density above the LH resonance density appears to be impossible according to this model.},

These equations possess three independent solutions, one more than the Maxwell equations in vacuum; to establish the additional condition at a plasma-boundary interface needed to define unambiguouslythe causal solution in the plasma, it is shown that HF diamagnetic currents (proportional to the gradients of the equilibrium plasma parameters) remain finite in the limit in which the thickness of the plasma-vacuum transition is assumed to be negligible compared with the perpendicular wavelength of the incident waves. The discontinuity of the compressional component of the wave field due to these HF surface currents can be expressed in terms of the FLR contributions to the coefficients of the wave equations, so that the FLR boundary conditions can be formulated in a fully explicit manner. It is also shown that these conditions guarantee the continuity of the power flux through the plasma surface. These boundary conditions have been used to obtain analytic expressions for the surface impedance matrix of a plasma in the FLR approximation, assuming that the WKB solutions to the wave equations can be used near the plasma edge. These analytic results can be used to check numerical solutions of the wave equations against a known case, and to speed up the solution of antenna coupling problems in large plasmas.},

The thermalized population of {$\alpha$}-particles is not a serious competitor for power absorption as long as their number density is compatible with maintenance of ignition. By contrast, the energetic slowing down fraction, in spite of its even greater dilution, can absorb from the waves a substantial amount of power at the cyclotron resonance and its harmonics. An extensive exploration both in frequency and in toroidal wavenumbers using the parameters of one of the European versions of DEMO shows that three frequency windows exist in which damping is nevertheless predominantly on the electrons. Designing an antenna capable of shaping the launched spectrum to optimize current drive, however, will not be straightforward. Only in a narrow range when the first IC harmonic of tritium is deep inside the plasma on the high-field side of the magnetic axis, and that of deuterium and helium is still outside on the low-field side, it appears possible to achieve a satisfactory current drive efficiency with a conventional multi-strap antenna, preferentially located in the upper part of the vessel. Exploiting the other two windows at quite low and quite high frequencies is either impossible on first principles, or will demand novel ideas in antenna design.},

This paper describes a number of compact semiconductor device and circuit macromodelling techniques that have been implemented in recent Qucs releases, stressing those techniques that are not found in SPICE 2g6 or 3f5. It also introduces a novel hierarchical approach to Verilog-A compact model and circuit macromodel construction based on non-linear equation-defined devices, linear-controlled sources and noise generators embedded in subcircuits. To illustrate the new approach, the properties and models of a number of components with electrical and non-electrical characteristics are described. These models demonstrate how recent trends in open source simulation technology use embedded equations as integral elements in component and physical process models.

  abstract = {In many fields of science and industry the computing environment has grown at an exponential speed in the past 30 years. From ad hoc solutions for each problem, the field has evolved gradually to use or reuse systems developed across the years for the same environment or coming from other fields with the same requirements. Several frameworks have emerged to solve common problems. In High Energy Physics (HEP) and Nuclear Physics, we have witnessed the emergence of common tools, packages and libraries that have become gradually the corner stone of the computing in these fields. The emergence of these systems has been complex because the computing field is evolving rapidly, the problems to be solved more and more complex and the size of the experiments now involving several thousand physicists from all over the world. This paper describes the emergence of these frameworks and their evolution from libraries including independent subroutines to task-oriented packages and to general experiments frameworks.},

The new configuration will allow for H-mode access, providing relevant plasma conditions for PFC technology validation. Furthermore, attractive steady-state regimes are expected to be achievable. The lower divertor target design will be closely based on that currently envisaged for ITER (W monoblocks), while the upper divertor region will be used to qualify the main first wall heat sink technology adopted for the ITER blanket modules (CuCrZr copper/stainless steel) with a tungsten coating (in place of the Be tiles which ITER will use). Extended plasma exposure will provide access to ITER critical issues such as PFC lifetime (melting, cracking, etc.), tokamak operation on damaged metallic surfaces, real time heat flux control through PFC monitoring, fuel retention and dust production.},

This paper reports on a new customengineered, electroplated, nano-crystalline silver alloy (NCSA) material stack that differentiates itself from both traditional hard gold and other silver technologies by offering improved wear durability up to and beyond 104 mating cycles, as well as improved corrosion protection for immersion environmental exposures. Voltage-biased immersion tests involving common liquids such as perspiration and saline solutions as well as high cycling wear beyond 104 mating cycles have been conducted on a gold-on-nickel stack as well as two embodiments of the new NCSA final finish stack: 1) with the NCSA plated onto a nano-crystalline nickel-tungsten alloy (NCNA) as a barrier layer and 2) with the NCSA plated directly on the substrate with no nickel-based barrier layer. Both embodiments of the NCSA stack exhibited at least equivalent performance, and in some cases outperformed a standard gold-on-nickel stack in both wear durability and biased corrosion resistance.},

In the first experiment the magnetic field was practically aligned with the screen elements, whereas in the second experiment the toroidal field was reversed and the angle between the elements and the field was 25\textdegree. There were clear differences in the impurity influx, the heating efficiency and the coupling resistance between discharges with normal field and discharges with reversed field. The results indicate the impact of the Faraday screen design on the levels of RF enhanced metal influxes originating at the screen. This should be of particular relevance for the ICRF antennas in a reactor where, in contrast to small devices, most of the interaction between the RF fields and the plasma edge is expected to take place around the antenna structures because of the highly localized RF field patterns. A numerical code based on three-dimensional single-pass and full wave calculations of antenna-plasma coupling, including an arbitrary angle between the screen elements and the magnetic field, can qualitatively reproduce the observed difference in the coupling resistance. The experimental results are discussed with regard to possible mechanisms that can account for the observed differences in the two cases studied.},

The advanced tokamak represents a highly attractive approach for a future steady state fusion power plant. In this concept, there is a natural alignment between high pressure operation, favorable stability and transport properties, and a highly self-driven (`bootstrap') plasma current to sustain operation efficiently and without disruptions. Research on DIII-D has identified several promising plasma configurations for fully non-inductive operation with potential applications to a range of future devices, from ITER to nuclear science facilities, to compact or large scale fusion power plants. Significant progress has been made toward realizing these scenarios, with the demonstration of high b access, off-axis current drive techniques, model based profile control, and stability and ELM control in reactor relevant physics regimes. Radiative techniques have also been pioneered to develop improved compatibility with divertor requirements, and simultaneous access to high performance pedestals. Research has also developed major advances in physics understanding, validating concepts of kinetic damping of ideal MHD instabilities that enable high b operation, identifying how current profile and b influence plasma turbulence in order to validate and improve turbulent transport models, and understanding the physics of energetic particle redistribution due to Alfve\textasciiacute nic and other instabilities. These advances have been partnered with development of a rigorous integrated modeling framework used to interpret and validate individual physics models of the various aspects of plasma behavior, and to guide development of improved regimes and upgrades. These tools are also being used to develop and validate concepts for future reactors directly. Having established these foundations, DIII-D is now undergoing a substantial upgrade to raise power, current drive, electron heating and 3-D field capabilities in order to validate this physics and test conceptual solutions in reactor-relevant physics regimes, with a goal to resolve the key scientific and technology questions to enable a decision on a future steady state fusion power plant.},

However, the antenna also has a finite poloidal extent and a corresponding poloidal wavenumber spectrum.

In order to predict the efficiency of the current drive and where it takes place in the tokamak profile, computational techniques which couple calculations of the wave field to Fokker\textendash Planck solutions of the electron distribution function have been developed. In the electron cyclotron and lower hybrid (LH) frequency ranges the wave field is often calculated using ray tracing techniques, though more recently some full wave calculations have been done. Ray tracing provides a simpler way of proceeding, but the problem arises of dealing with the situation in which there is not a single well defined beam and diffraction and beam divergence are important. Since an LH antenna produces a complicated spectrum, launching waves in a range of directions, the problem is particularly acute there. In this paper we suggest a way of calculating the wave field from tracing of multiple rays using a technique based on the stationary phase approximation. We demonstrate how it can be used and its effectiveness through a number of simple examples.},

By inserting the ILSRNs, the complex interconnections can be converted into the standard one-by-one case without changing the characteristics of the previous microwave networks. Based on the algorithm of the generalized cascade scattering matrix, a useful derivation on the excitation coefficients of antenna arrays is firstly proposed with consideration of the coupling effects. And then, the proposed techniques are applied on the microwave circuits and antenna arrays. Firstly, an improved magic-T is optimized, fabricated, and measured. Compared with the existing results, the prototype has a wider bandwidth, lower insertion loss, better return loss, isolation, and imbalances. Secondly, two typical linear waveguide slotted arrays are designed. Both the radiation patterns and scattering parameters at the input ports agree well with the desired goals. Finally, the feeding network of a two-element microstrip antenna array is optimized to decrease the mismatch at the input port, and a good impedance matching is successfully achieved.},

  abstract = {The active control of the radial current density profile is one of the major issues of thermonuclear fusion energy research based on magnetic confinement. The lower hybrid current drive could in principle be used as an efficient tool. However, previous understanding considered the electron temperature envisaged in a reactor at the plasma periphery too large to allow penetration of the coupled radio frequency (RF) power due to strong Landau damping. In this work, we present new numerical results based on quasilinear theory, showing that the injection of power spectra with different n// widths of the main lobe produce an RF-driven current density profile spanning most of the outer radial half of the plasma (n// is the refractive index in a parallel direction to the confinement magnetic field). Plasma kinetic profiles envisaged for the DEMO reactor are used as references. We demonstrate the robustness of the modeling results concerning the key role of the spectral width in determining the lower hybrid-driven current density profile. Scans of plasma parameters are extensively carried out with the aim of excluding the possibility that any artefact of the utilised numerical modeling would produce any novelty. We neglect here the parasitic effect of spectral broadening produced by linear scattering due to plasma density fluctuations, which mainly occurs for low magnetic field devices. This effect will be analyzed in other work that completes the report on the present breakthrough.},

Well assessed numerical tools have been used for the solution of the relevant electromagnetic wave equation coupled to the quasi-linear Fokker-Planck equation for the ion distribution function, and the TOrino Polytechnic Ion Cyclotron Antenna (TOPICA) has been used to calculate the launcher design and the coupling performance of the antenna and the wave spectrum in presence of a plasma load.

The chaotic diffusion of the ``time-averaged'' parallel wave number at higher values (with respect to that launched by the antenna at the plasma edge) has been evaluated, in order to find an explanation of the filling of the spectral gap (Fisch, 1987) by ``Hamiltonian chaos'' in the Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) experiments (Fisch, 1978). The present work shows that the increase of the parallel wave number n due to toroidal effects, in the case of the typical plasma parameters of the Frascati Tokamak Upgrade (FTU) experiment, is insufficient to explain the filling of the spectral gap, and the consequent current drive and another mechanism must come into play to justify the wave absorption by Landau damping. Analytical calculations have been supplemented by a numerical algorithm based on the symplectic integration of the ray equations implemented in a ray tracing code, in order to preserve exactly the symplectic character of a Hamiltonian flow.},

RF breakdown/arcing is a major power-limiting factor in antenna systems used for RF heating and current drive in fusion experiments. The factors that contribute to breakdown include gas pressure, gas type, magnetic field, materials, ultraviolet light, and local plasma density. The effects of these factors on RF breakdown are being studied in a resonant 1/4-wavelength section of vacuum transmission line terminated with an open circuit electrode structure. The electrode structure is designed to determine the role of the RF electric field strength and magnetic field orientation on the breakdown process. Changes in the electrical parameters, such as input impedance and the voltage at the electrodes, are being monitored to detect the breakdown events. Measurements of the light emission prior to and during an arc are also being made. For high vacuum conditions using copper electrodes, bright spots appear on the electrode surfaces prior to a breakdown event. An increase in the RF field results in an arc and a flash of light corresponding to copper line emission (578.2 or 521.8 nm). Analysis of the electrode surfaces show large areas of melting and formation of micron-sized rounded protrusions, especially along the sharp edges of small scratches. An increase in the chamber pressure results in a decrease in the maximum RF electric field that can be sustained without breakdown as the pressure approaches a few mTorr. The breakdown event leads to formation of a plasma in the structure, with light emission corresponding to the particular gas being used. The addition of an external magnetic field causes the formation of a plasma at lower pressures, thus limiting the amount of coupled RF power. The presence of UV light has been found to initiate multipactor under some operating conditions.},

DTT will rely on an unprecedented amount of additional heating power, including ion-cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF), to attain a DEMO-relevant power-over-radius ratio crossing the separatrix. This paper reports the status of the ICRF conceptual design, providing the rationale behind main design choices to couple 3 MW to the first DTT plasmafuss (day-1) and up to 10 MW after machine upgrade to full power. The most suitable antenna concepts are identified according to performance documented in literature along with matching schemes able to face fast variation of plasma admittance, and the state-of-the-art of DTT-relevant radiofrequency sources is briefly sketched too. Some preliminary antenna designs are compared on the basis of simulation results, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate.},

  abstract = {In many configurations, an antenna has to be protected from the outer environment by a radome. In this thesis, we propose to use gaussian beam based techniques to take into account the radome effect on the antenna radiation. These beams are approximate analytical solutions of the propagation equation. They depend on the paraxial approximation (low diverging field assumption). We first develop a new approach to expand an electromagnetic field on a set of elementary beams, overcoming some limitations of the two existing expansions (Multimodal and Gabor). Then, we study the interaction between an incident field and a multilayer dielectric object. So, we develop a shooting and bouncing gaussian beam algorithm which assumes that one incident gaussian beam crossing a dielectric interface gives one reflected and one transmitted gaussian beams. Another original technique is proposed using gaussian beam transmission and reflection coefficients. They provide analytical expressions for the transmitted and reflected fields on a dielectric interface (or on a thin dielectric multilayer) illuminated by a gaussian beam. These two techniques are compared with a conventional plane wave approach on several test cases. The results show their rapidity and accuracy. In order to deal with the problem of aircraft or missiles front-end sharp radomes, we finally explore novel expansions requiring a new kind of beams, called ``conformal gaussian beams''. Some comparisons with simulations performed with an existing industrial software show their efficiency.},

The Faraday shielding effect depends upon the wires having finite radius and is weaker than one might expect, scaling as | log r|/n in an appropriate regime of small r and large n. Both numerical results and a mathematical theorem are provided. By the method of multiple scales, a continuum approximation is then derived in the form of a homogenized boundary condition for the Laplace equation along a curve. The homogenized equation reveals that in a Faraday cage, charge moves so as to somewhat cancel an external field, but not enough for the cancellation to be fully effective. Physically, the effect is one of electrostatic induction in a surface of limited capacitance. An alternative discrete model of the effect is also derived based on a principle of energy minimization. Extensions to electromagnetic waves and 3D geometries are mentioned.},

  abstract = {Tore Supra routinely addresses the physics and technology of very long-duration plasma discharges, thus bringing key information on critical issues of long pulse/steady-state operation of ITER. During the last two years, its scientific programme has entered a new phase towards higher power long pulse. Considerable progress has been accomplished towards reliable and safe operation at multi-MW power level in an actively cooled plasma facing components (PFCs) environment. Discharges lasting several resistive times, with combined lower hybrid current drive and ion cyclotron resonant heating at high power level, in plasmas close to the Greenwald limit and Ti close to Te have been obtained. Improved confinement has been maintained together with q(0) {$\sim$} 1.5 for durations up to 20 s. An advanced scheme for the physics and operational integration of plasma scenarios has been developed, and discharges at 7 MW total injected power level have been controlled in an MHD stable region for 60 s. The unique capability of the reflectometry system of Tore Supra has allowed detailed studies of particle/energy transport, and a weak dependence of confinement with {$\beta$} is corroborated by fluctuation measurements. A new mechanism is proposed to explain the D retention observed in long pulses. Analysis of large parallel flows in the scrape off layer (SOL) lends credence to the hypothesis that the SOL is fed by long range transport events that are created near the outboard midplane. Finally, new technological developments for in situ follow-up of PFCs ageing are reported.},

To be a platform of ITER technologies of high heat flux components testing, three sets of Ion Cyclotron Resonant Heating (ICRH) antennas have been designed to inject 9MW during 30s or 3MW during 1000s. The antenna design is based on a load resilient prototype successfully tested in Tore Supra in 2007. In order to allow continuous-wave (CW) operations, the mechanical design of the WEST ICRH antenna is emphasized on its cooling performances by designing fully active cooling structure. Two kinds of cooling water loops are used, with temperature and pressure of 70\textdegree C/30bar and 25\textdegree C/5.2bar, respectively. The hot water loop is used for the Faraday screen (FS) and the housing box (HB), while the cold water loop is used for the straps, the matching capacitors and the impedance transformer. To enhance the heat removal ability and control the pressure drop, the cooling channels in the FS and HB are drilled directly and parallel connected as much as possible. By performing the hydraulic\textendash thermal analysis, the lack of cooling efficiency was found in the front face of lateral collector where 1MW/m2 is imposed and fluid dead zones were found in some of the bars. After optimization, the cooling performance of the cooling circuit increased significantly. With a mass flow rate of 2.5kg/s, the total pressure drop is 3.1bar, and the peak temperatures on the FS and HB are 500\textdegree C and 261\textdegree C, respectively. Besides, no cavitation is found in the total cooling circuit.},

  abstract = {The power threshold for low (L) to high (H) confinement mode transition achieved by radio-frequency (RF) heating and lithium-wall coating is investigated experimentally on EAST for two sets of walls: an all carbon wall (C) and molybdenum chamber and a carbon divertor (Mo/C). For both sets of walls, a minimum power threshold P thr of 0.6 MW was found when the EAST operates in a double null (DN) divertor configuration with intensive lithium-wall coating. When operating in upper single null (USN) or lower single null (LSN), the power threshold depends on the ion {$\nabla$}B drift direction. The low density dependence of the L\textendash H power threshold, namely an increase below a minimum density, was identified in the Mo/C wall for the first time. For the C wall only the single-step L\textendash H transition with limited injection power is observed whereas also the so-called dithering L\textendash H transition is observed in the Mo/C wall. The dithering behaves distinctively in a USN, DN and LSN configuration, suggesting the divertor pumping capability is an important ingredient in this transition since the internal cryopump is located underneath the lower divertor. Depending on the chosen divertor configuration, the power across the separatrix P loss increases with neutral density near the lower X-point in EAST with the Mo/C wall, consistent with previous results in the C wall (Xu et al 2011 Nucl. Fusion 51 072001). These findings suggest that the edge neutral density, the ion {$\nabla$}B drift as well as the divertor pumping capability play important roles in the L\textendash H power threshold and transition behaviour.},

  abstract = {Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequency (ICRF) heating has been adopted in EAST tokamak as one of main auxiliary heating methods. The ICRF antenna usually consists of multiple launching elements because of limited port and space of tokamak device. Mutual coupling between straps has been observed in previous EAST ICRF current drive experiments. Due to adverse effects of such mutual coupling, many issues induced by cross power cannot be ignored, such as power imbalance in feed lines, high voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), and etc. To restrain such mutual coupling, A device named decoupler was developed and tested in EAST ICRF system. According to the admittance matrix of load, three assembly positions (oscillation position, optimum position, and smooth position) along transmission line for the decoupler were taken into account and tested. The test results showed that ohmic dissipation in decoupler could not be neglected, which partly influenced the decoupling performance. The oscillation position and optimum position could restrain such adverse effects of ohmic dissipation and showed good decoupling performance. However, they cannot ensure the steady operation during H-mod due to the load variation. Finally, the smooth position has been adopted for EAST I port antenna because of steady decoupling performance comprised with engineering error and load resilience, which sincerely enhance the capability of system operation.},

Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) system is one of the three heating systems which will supply total heating power of 20 MW (40-55 MHz) up to one hour of operation. Radio-Frequency (RF) contacts are integrated within the antennas for assembly and operation considerations, which will face extremely harsh service conditions, including neutron irradiation, heavy electrical loads (RF current reaches up to 2 kA with a linear current density of 4.8 kA/m) and high thermal loads.

Few weeks of vacuum ( 10-5Pa) baking at 250\textdegree C for outgassing is expected before each plasma experimental campaign, under which the RF contact materials' mechanical properties change and diffusion phenomena between different materials are inevitable. CuCrZr and 316L are proper base materials for ITER RF contact louvers and conductors respectively. In order to improve the RF contact's wear and corrosion resistivity as well as to reduce the contact resistance, Au-Ni and Rh functional layers could be electroplated on CuCrZr and 316L accordingly. The application of the Au-Ni/Rh coating pairs is assessed through the thermal ageing and diffusion tests.

In this paper, both finite element method (FEM) and experimental method were applied to investigate the effects of thermal ageing on mechanical performance of Rh coating after 250 \textdegree C, 500 h baking in vacuum. Based on FEM analysis, thermal stresses which concentrate at Rh coating interface is the main source of cracking, and such stresses can be minimized efficiently by introducing a 0.5 {$\mu$}m Au interlayer into the coating layer structure. According to thermal ageing experiments, through-thickness cracking in the Rh coating due to thermal stress releasing and voids generated at the Rh bonding interface caused by Kirkendall effect were the main micro-structure changes in the coating system. The solid-solution hardening caused by significant Cu diffusion into Rh is the dominant factor that affected the Rh coating's hardness. The existing of large amount of cracks in the Rh coating and voids at the Rh coating interface deteriorated the adhesion performance of Rh on CuCrZr substrate by 30\%.},

  abstract = {Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) is one of the most important plasma heating methods in magnetically confined fusion experiments. In ITER, two ICRH antennas are designed to supply 20 MW of Radio-Frequency (RF) power at 40-55 MHz to heat the plasma. RF sliding contacts are used in the antennas to allow their remote handling assembly and to improve their maintainability, as well as to absorb the thermal expansion of the RF conductors during operations. One of the RF contacts is designed to be operated at 2.25 kA in steady-state (1200 s), with a current density of 4.8 kA/m. With such current levels, high heating occurs at the contact area which threatens the structural and material safety of the RF contacts and constrain their life time. In addition, before operation of the ITER ICRH antennas, all the in-vessel structures will be baked at 250\textdegree C during thousands of cumulated hours for outgassing. In CEA, R\&D work on RF contact development has been carried out for 10 years. Recently, Ag-coated CuCrZr louvers RF contact prototype based on Multi-Contact LA-CUT commercial contact configuration was tested on TITAN test-bed. 1500 A, 1200 s steady-state operation was achieved. However, due to burn failure, the RF contact prototype couldn't reach 1200 s steady-state under 2 kA as expected. In order to improve the performances of the RF sliding contacts to match ITER requirements, failure mechanisms of RF contacts during RF operations were analyzed and possible materials or coated systems that can be used for RF sliding contacts compatible with the ITER environment have been studied in detail within this thesis work. The effects of material selection, cooling parameter and contact resistance on louvers temperature have been modelled and simulated through finite element methods. Moreover, functional coatings like Ag, Au, Rh and their alloys were manufactured by electroplating on 316L and CuCrZr, which are commonly used as base materials on tokamak. By mimicking the ITER baking conditions, the coated samples were thermal aged under vacuum at 250\textordmasculine C for 500 h, after which the materials properties evolution such as hardness, grain size and adherence was characterized. In addition, the coating life time has been evaluated through cross-sectional diffusion characterizations. In order to evaluate the electrical and tribological behavior of the coated material pairs, a dedicated and innovative test bed was designed during this thesis and used successfully. On this test bed the samples can be heated up to 350\textordmasculine C and the vacuum can reach 10-5 Pa. Static contact resistance as well as transient contact resistance/friction coefficient of sliding pairs can be measured. Sliding and electrical tests of uncoated 316L/CuCrZr pair and coated pairs Ag/Rh and Au-Ni/Rh were carried out. The relationships between vacuum condition, temperature, contact force and the static contact resistance have been studied and an optimal contact force was selected. Under this optimal contact force, the sliding tests were launched and the evolutions of friction coefficient as well as contact resistance were analyzed. Through wear characterizations, the life times of the coatings were evaluated. Finally, based on the first tribological results obtained on commercial Au-Ni and Au-Co alloy coatings, the feasibility of depositing solid lubricant containing Au-Ni and Au-Co composite coatings to minimizing wear and friction coefficient was evaluated. Au-Ni/a-C and Au-Co/WS2 composite coatings were successfully developed by using magnetron sputtering and electroplating methods respectively. Their tribological performance under ITER relevant vacuum condition had been studied.},

  abstract = {Integral Equation Methods for Electromagnetic and Elastic Waves is an outgrowth of several years of work. There have been no recent books on integral equation methods. There are books written on integral equations, but either they have been around for a while, or they were written by mathematicians. Much of the knowledge in integral equation methods still resides in journal papers. With this book, important relevant knowledge for integral equations are consolidated in one place and researchers need only read the pertinent chapters in this book to gain important knowledge needed for integral equation research. Also, learning the fundamentals of linear elastic wave theory does not require a quantum leap for electromagnetic practitioners.},

  abstract = {A highly efficient Guassian beam (GB) method was recently developed to provide a relatively rapid analysis of large reflector antennas. This GB method is very efficient because it represents the feed radiation in terms of a set of very few rotationally symmetric GBs and provides an essentially closed form solution for the reflection and diffraction of each GB incidence on the reflector surface. In contrast, conventional approaches evaluate the radiated field via a numerical integration of the physical optics integral over the large reflector surface; such numerical techniques are time consuming for large reflectors. However, the fast GB method becomes less accurate if each GB illuminating spot on the reflecting surface is comparable to the overall reflector size, since its closed-form solution requires a small spot size. This liinitation of the GB approach happens particularly in situations where the feed is located relatively far from the reflector, since the GBs are not able to remain narrow in the angular and spatial domains simultaneously,thereby creating too large a spot size on the reflector surface. The above limitation of the GBs is overcome here by introducing a Gaussian-ray basis fhction (GRBF), a hybridisation of a geometrical optics (GO) ray tube and a GB. Owing to its similarity with a GB in the amplitude variation transverse to the ray, its incorporation into any existing GB code is straightforward. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the new GRBF approach.},

  abstract = {In addition to the propagation and absorption of the waves into the plasma, a crucial point in ion cyclotron radiofrequency heating (ICRH) is to know how the energy is coupled to the plasma. The coupling efficiency is experimentally estimated through measurements of the antenna coupling resistance and it is of primary importance to precisely establish its dependence on the plasma parameters. The coupling resistance is highly connected to the density profile, which determines the cut-off positions of the magnetosonic waves for a given radiated wave number spectrum. For a large size tokamak like Tore Supra these cut-off densities range between 1018 and 1019 m-3, corresponding to the plasma edge. In this study, the RF coupling is investigated with respect to the plasma edge density profile measured by X-mode reflectometry and a characteristic cut-off position of the magnetosonic wave. We show that the edge density is not only a function of the average density but also depends in a complex way, on various edge plasma regimes, the power deposition, or the kind of limiter materials or divertor perturbation used to control the edge. Over a large variety of plasma edge regimes, it is shown how the distance between a characteristic ICRH cut-off density layer and the antenna is the relevant parameter to address the problem of the RF coupling efficiency. Simulation of the coupling process with the three-dimensional antenna code Ion Cyclotron ANTenna compares well with RF measurements, provided that the experimental density profiles are used in the computations.},

This is done via a Green's function, determined from the ICRF wave coupling equations, and well-suited to open field lines extending toroidally far away on both sides of the antenna. Using such formalism, combined with a full-wave calculation using the 3D antenna code ICANT (Pe\textasciiacute coul S. et al 2000 Comput. Phys. Commun. 146 166\textendash 87), two classes of convective cells are analysed. The first one appears in front of phased arrays of straps, and depending on the strap phasing, its topology is interpreted using the poloidal profiles of either the RF current or the RF voltage of the strip line theory. The other class of convective cells is specific to antenna box corners and is evidenced for the first time. Based on such analysis, general design rules are worked out in order to reduce the RF-sheath potentials, which generalize those proposed in the earlier literature, and concrete antenna design options are tested numerically. The merits of aligning all strap centres on the same (tilted) flux tube, and of reducing the antenna box toroidal conductivity in its lower and upper parts, are discussed.},

Conversely, the specific focus of Tore Supra toward long-duration discharges places its heating system in an original position in the ion cyclotron community. High-power long-pulse requirements motivated innovative design choices and operational methods. Over long pulses, the physics of rf waves in the plasma edge early emerged as a crucial issue that was abundantly studied and benefited from original diagnostic techniques, some of which still remain unique in the magnetic fusion community. This paper reviews ICRH technology and physics on Tore Supra, from the generators and antennas to the central plasma via the scrape-off layer. Emphasis is put on the experience gained over 20 years of experimental and theoretical activity. Lessons are drawn for next-step devices.},

  abstract = {We investigate theoretically how sheath radio-frequency (RF) oscillations relate to the spatial structure of the near RF parallel electric field E{$\parallel$} emitted by ion cyclotron (IC) wave launchers. We use a simple model of slow wave (SW) evanescence coupled with direct current (DC) plasma biasing via sheath boundary conditions in a 3D parallelepiped filled with homogeneous cold magnetized plasma. Within a `wide-sheath' asymptotic regime, valid for large-amplitude near RF fields, the RF part of this simple RF\,\,+\,\,DC model becomes linear: the sheath oscillating voltage VRF at open field line boundaries can be re-expressed as a linear combination of individual contributions by every emitting point in the input field map. SW evanescence makes individual contributions all the larger as the wave emission point is located closer to the sheath walls. The decay of |VRF| with the emission point/sheath poloidal distance involves the transverse SW evanescence length and the radial protrusion depth of lateral boundaries. The decay of |VRF| with the emitter/sheath parallel distance is quantified as a function of the parallel SW evanescence length and the parallel connection length of open magnetic field lines. For realistic geometries and target SOL plasmas, poloidal decay occurs over a few centimeters. Typical parallel decay lengths for |VRF| are found to be smaller than IC antenna parallel extension. Oscillating sheath voltages at IC antenna side limiters are therefore mainly sensitive to E{$\parallel$} emission by active or passive conducting elements near these limiters, as suggested by recent experimental observations. Parallel proximity effects could also explain why sheath oscillations persist with antisymmetric strap toroidal phasing, despite the parallel antisymmetry of the radiated field map. They could finally justify current attempts at reducing the RF fields induced near antenna boxes to attenuate sheath oscillations in their vicinity.},

We recall the PML formulation as an artificial inhomogeneous lossy medium, following the stretching into the complex plane of a general system of three orthogonal curvilinear coordinates. We apply the general method in cylindrical and toroidal geometries. We then assess this technique in a simple case combining gyrotropy and coordinate curvature. Our test problem analytically quantifies the reflection of Transverse Electric (TE) cylindrical eigenmodes in a gyrotropic medium by a radial PML in cylindrical geometry. The obtained reflection coefficient involves wave, PML and geometric parameters at the PML location. The new coefficient generalizes the one obtained earlier with Cartesian coordinates, and becomes equivalent when the effects of the local cylindrical curvature at the PML (stretched) location can be neglected. These curvature effects are outlined and the limitations they impose on the properties of the PML are quantified as a function of the relevant parameters. Peculiarities related to the gyrotropy are also highlighted. Finite element calculations of the test problem in two-dimensional cylindrical geometry are exploited to verify these properties numerically. Indications are finally given on how to choose the PML parameters in order to obtain a minimal wave reflection at given numerical cost, taking into account errors associated with the numerical scheme.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that the route to fusion power involves large devices of ITER scale or larger. However, we show, contrary to expectations, that for steady state tokamaks operating at fixed fractions of the density and beta limits, the fusion gain, Qfus, depends mainly on the absolute level of the fusion power and the energy confinement, and only weakly on the device size. Our investigations are carried out using a system code and also by analytical means. Further, we show that for the two qualitatively different global scalings that have been developed to fit the data contained in the ITER ELMy H-mode database, i.e. the normally used beta-dependent IPB98y2 scaling and the alternative beta-independent scalings, the power needed for high fusion performance differs substantially, typically by factors of three to four. Taken together, these two findings imply that lower power, smaller, and hence potentially lower cost, pilot plants and reactors than currently envisaged may be possible. The main parameters of a candidate low power ({$\sim$}180 MW), high Qfus ({$\sim$}5), relatively small ({$\sim$}1.35 m major radius) device are given.},

This paper considers a fixed frequency RF oven, where a matching circuit is used to ensure that the combined impedance of the oven and the food (the load) matches the impedance of the generator and the transmission line. A controller measures the reflected RF signal and adjusts the settings of components in the matching circuit. The system is highly nonlinear and there are significant sources of uncertainty in the model of the process. A variable structure controller is designed and its stability is examined in the presence of uncertainties due to stray components. The switching lines are defined in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the reflected signal, which avoids the need to estimate the states. Conditions are derived for maintaining stability in the region close to the matching point. The performance of the controller is illustrated by results from an implementation on a prototype commercial RF oven.},

  abstract = {An electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) system capable of delivering 2.4 MW cw has been designed to be built at Commissariat \`a l'Energie Atomique, Cadarache, for the Tore Supra (TS) experiment, to provide plasma heating and current drive by electron cyclotron resonance interaction. The planned system was composed of a generator using six gyrotrons 500 kW for 5 s or 400 kW cw working at 118 GHz. Six transmission lines made of corrugated waveguide, 63.5-mm diameter, carry the HE11 mode to one antenna composed of six fixed mirrors and three independently movable mirrors for the adjustment of the injection angles of the rf beams. The antenna was built and installed in TS, and all transmission line components ordered and installed between the gyrotron locations and the antenna. In the same way, the required six oil tanks, the six cryomagnets, and the six modulating anode devices were designed and manufactured. In parallel, after demonstration in the factory of proper operation of the prototype gyrotron, the manufacture of a first so-called series gyrotron was made. But this gyrotron experienced hard limitations (overheating inducing prohibited outgassing, parasitic oscillations) during the long-pulse tests in Cadarache, and the achieved performance was 300 kW for 110 s. A new study was then carried out in collaboration with Thales Electron Devices, the EURATOM-CE A Association, and the EURATOM-Conf\'ed\'eration Suisse Association to understand and overcome the limitations, which led to the construction of a new modified gyrotron. During the tests in factory of this new gyrotron, the output beam showed two peaks, a pattern never predicted by simulations. The gyrotron was nevertheless transferred to Cadarache for long-pulse testing, but an arc on the windows definitely stopped the tests. To understand the cause of the observed two peaks, various low-level tests were then performed on a model of the mode converter with different shapes for the launcher, but without real improvement. Besides measurements, the use of a new software, Surf3D, based on integral equations and providing a complete threedimensional modeling, showed that the problem mainly comes from the third mirror, whose curvature is too high and consequently not well taken into account by the calculation. These technological problems have seriously delayed the development of the gyrotrons; as a consequence, only two tubes (intermediate developments) are presently available on TS to inject 700 kW in 5-s pulses. In spite of this relatively low power, the localized absorption property of electron cyclotron waves has been used on TS in a wide variety of experiments, such as stabilization and control of the sawtooth period, perturbative transport studies by ECRH modulations, and ECRH-assisted plasma start-up.},

  abstract = {A theoretical investigation has been made of the problem of electrical breakdown in a high frequency electrodeless discharge at low pressure in the presence of a steady transverse magnetic field following the method of von Engel et al. for similar discharge without such a field. Curves giving the breakdown field as a function of wavelength with {$\alpha$}, the ratio of the cyclotron frequency to the frequency of the applied field, have been drawn. It is shown that with increase in {$\alpha$} the breakdown field tends to increase and the main region of the curve displaced towards longer wavelengths. The increase in breakdown field with a given change in {$\alpha$} is found to be more pronounced with the higher order modes of discharge. The effect of angle of arrival at the end walls of the charged carriers on the breakdown mechanism has also been considered. Results indicate that the effect should counteract appreciably the aforesaid tendency of the breakdown field to increase in the presence of a magnetic field. The so-called cut-off values of wavelengths have also been computed. It is shown that the cut-off value increases with increase in {$\alpha$}, and in contrast to the situation in the absence of a magnetic field, might define either a long or short wavelength limit of discharge depending upon the value of {$\alpha$}.},

A combination of ray-tracing and Fokker\textendash Planck calculations are presented for various plasma scenarios, wave frequency and polarization. The dependence of the driven current and the location of power deposition upon the coupled wave spectrum is systematically determined, in order to set objectives for the antenna design. The respective effects of finite-power levels, magnetic trapping, and detailed antenna spectra are accounted for and quantitatively estimated. The sensitivity of LHCD to density and temperature profiles is calculated. From the simulation results, an optimum value for the parallel index of refraction is proposed as a compromise between efficiency and robustness with respect to those profile variations. The corresponding current drive efficiency is found to be similar for the two frequencies generally considered for ITER, f = 3.7 GHz and f = 5.0 GHz.},

The goal of this paper is to calculate a set of regression coefficients to reduce this data set to a tractable format for use in the materials selection and design of such components. Regression analysis could not be performed for all material properties for all of these materials, due to a lack of data in the literature, and these gaps in the available data are highlighted.},

  abstract = {It has been demonstrated that lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) systems play a crucial role for steady-state tokamak operation, owing to their high current drive (CD) efficiency and hence their capability to reduce flux consumption. This paper describes the extensive technology programmes developed for the Tore Supra (France) and the KSTAR (Korea) tokamaks in order to bring continuous wave (CW) LHCD systems into operation. The Tore Supra LHCD generator at 3.7 GHz is fully CW compatible, with RF power PRF = 9.2 MW available at the generator to feed two actively water-cooled launchers. On Tore Supra, the most recent and novel passive active multijunction (PAM) launcher has sustained 2.7 MW (corresponding to its design value of 25 MW m-2 at the launcher mouth) for a 78 s flat-top discharge, with low reflected power even at large plasma-launcher gaps. The fully active multijunction (FAM) launcher has reached 3.8 MW of coupled power (24 MW m-2 at the launcher mouth) with the new TH2103C klystrons. By combining both the PAM and FAM launchers, 950 MJ of energy, using 5.2 MW of LHCD and 1 MW of ICRH (ion cyclotron resonance heating), was injected for 160 s in 2011. The 3.7 GHz CW LHCD system will be a key element within the W (for tungsten) environment in steady-state Tokamak (WEST) project, where the aim is to test ITER technologies for high heat flux components in relevant heat flux density and particle fluence conditions. On KSTAR, a 2 MW LHCD system operating at 5 GHz is under development. Recently the 5 GHz prototype klystron has reached 500 kW/600 s on a matched load, and studies are ongoing to design a PAM launcher. In addition to the studies of technology, a combination of ray-tracing and Fokker\textendash Planck calculations have been performed to evaluate the driven current and the power deposition due to LH waves, and to optimize the N{$\parallel$} spectrum for the future launcher design. Furthermore, an LHCD system at 5 GHz is being considered for a future upgrade of the ITER Heating and Current Drive systems, with a power capability of 20 MW coupled to the plasma using a PAM launcher. An R\&D programme is being conducted at CEA/IRFM to develop a BeO vacuum window which is a safety critical component of the transmission line. In addition, a mock-up of a TE10\textendash TE30 mode converter at 5 GHz, designed for a rectangular transmission line, has been manufactured and successfully tested on Tore Supra at low RF power.},

Because of the similarity of many aspects of dc and rf breakdown, a dc breakdown study is underway at CERN in order to test candidate materials and surface preparations, and have a better understanding of the breakdown mechanism under ultrahigh vacuum in a simple setup. Conditioning speeds and breakdown fields of several metals and alloys have been measured. The average breakdown field after conditioning ranges from 100 MV/m for Al to 850 MV/m for stainless steel, and is around 170 MV/m for Cu which is the present base-line material for CLIC structures. The results indicate clearly that the breakdown field is limited by the cathode. The presence of a thin cuprous oxide film at the surface of copper electrodes significantly increases the breakdown field. On the other hand, the conditioning speed of Mo is improved by removing oxides at the surface with a vacuum heat treatment, typically at 875\textdegree C for 2 hours. Surface finishing treatments of Cu samples only affect the very first breakdowns. More generally, surface treatments have an effect on the conditioning process itself, but not on the average breakdown field reached after the conditioning phase. In analogy to rf, the breakdown probability has been measured in dc with Cu and Mo electrodes. The dc data show similar behavior as rf as a function of the applied electric field.},

One of the detectors, the Sub-Harmonic Arc Detector (SHAD) is based on the detection of the frequencies emitted in the MHz range by arcs [1], and is consequently resilient to fast load changes. A prototype has been in operation on ASDEX-Upgrade for ten years and has demonstrated its capability to detect arcs. However, to reach the safety level required by ITER, the design has to be modified to eliminate the spurious detections triggered by plasma emission in the MHz range and to enhance the sensitivity to low-voltage arcs. These improvements, which must preserve the simplicity of the system to guarantee its reliability, are based on the experience of RF arcs in resonant structures acquired on ASDEX-Upgrade and on dedicated test-benches. We present the main features of arcs in time and frequency domains and their impact on the behaviour of the SHAD system. Several technological solutions are based on these data and have to support the harsh environment of a burning plasma experiment. The shielding, the location of the detector, the reliability can be affected by the nuclear radiations. These elements are integrated in the design to make of the SHAD a primary safety system for ICRF heating.},

It is equipped with a magnetized plasma source (1 m long, 0.4 m diameter) powered by a helical antenna up to 3 kW at 11 MHz. We present the results of the first analysis of the plasma characteristics (plasma density, electron temperature) in function of the operating parameters (injected power, neutral pressure and magnetic field) as measured with fixed and movable Langmuir probes, spectrometer and cameras. The plasma is presently produced only by the helical antenna (no ICRF). We show that the plasma exists in three regime depending on the power level: the first two ones are stable and separated by a jump in density; a first spatial profile of the plasma density has been established for these modes; The third mode is unstable, characterized by strong oscillations of the plasma tube position.},

  abstract = {A technique for the measurement of the absolute electron density in low-pressure plasmas using microwaves is described. It is based on observing the propagation of electromagnetic surface waves (SW) at a plasma-sheath boundary, guided by a dielectric cylinder immersed in the plasma. The transmission spectrum is measured between two antennas situated at either end of the dielectric cylinder and connected to a network analyser. Analytical theory based on the Trivelpiece\textendash Gould work (Trivelpiece and Gould 1959 J. Appl. Phys. 30 1784, Trivelpiece 1967 Slow-Wave Propagation in Plasma Waveguides) indicate{$\surd$}s that the lowest frequency at which the SW can propagate is equal to 1/ 2 of the plasma frequency, which is directly related to the electron number density at the plasma-sheath boundary. We call this probe the plasma transmission probe (PTP) in contrast to the plasma absorption probe proposed by Sugai and co-workers (Kokura et al 1999 Japan. J. Appl. Phys. 38 5262). The PTP is promising for the measurement of low densities ( 109 cm-3) at relatively high gas pressure ( 1 Torr). An axi-symmetric finite element model of the probe is presented and used to calculate transmission spectra. Experimental spectra measured in a radio-frequency capacitively coupled discharge in argon at various plasma densities and pressures (40\textendash 750 mTorr) are presented and compared with the calculated ones. Plasma densities derived from the transmission spectra were compared with those obtained with a Langmuir probe. The PTP was also compared with a microwave 1/4-wave resonator (`hairpin probe') at low pressure (5\textendash 45 mTorr) in an ICP discharge in argon. The densities determined by the PTP were found to be lower by a factor of 0.5\textendash 0.7 compared with those obtained with a Langmuir and a hairpin probe. We believe this can be attributed to the pre-sheath plasma density gradient, as the PTP determines the sheath edge electron density, not the bulk value.},

Improved LHW-plasma coupling by means of local gas puffing and gas puffing from the electron side is routinely used during EAST operation with LHCD. High density experiments suggest that low recycling and high LH frequency are preferred for LHCD experiments at high density, consistent with previous results in other machines. The effect of LHCD on the current profile in EAST demonstrates that it is possible to control the plasma profile by optimizing the LHW spectrum. Repeatable H-mode plasma was obtained by LHCD and the maximum density during H-mode with the combination of 2.45 GHz and 4.6 GHz LH waves was up to 4.5\,\,\texttimes\,\,1019 m-3.},

These structures are often used to perform power division and combination operation. Folded H plane tee is one of the many components that can be used for the power division application. Its advantage is that the output arms and input arms are in a single plane along a single axis, thus taking less space in the overall system. However, their proper thermal management is indispensable for its use, as high surface temperature of the waveguide reduces its power handling capacity at high power level. This paper presents quick, easy design steps and methodology for obtaining the structure of a folded H plane tee at any given frequency of operation. Further, a scheme for the thermal management for high input power level (500 kW continuous wave) is presented. The proposed methodology is tested at various frequencies in COMSOL Multiphysics, CST Microwave Studio and HFSS with excellent results. A prototype structure was fabricated for use at 3.7 GHz, which exhibited good agreement with the simulation results.},

A prototype 500 kW CW klystron operating at 5 GHz was developed for the steady-state RF source. In this klystron, a multi-cell cavity is introduced to reduce cavity voltage and ohmic power loss. The klystron is designed with a triode system for optimization of gain, efficiency and beam control. The high voltage for the cathode is turned by using a thyristor switching system at the low voltage transformer unit. For anode voltage control, a mod-anode voltage divider system is used which utilize the parallel-circuit of the FET switch and Zener diodes. The RF output power of the klystron was 300 kW for 800 s and 450 kW for 20 s. The maximal temperature at collector top surface was 83 {$\smwhtcircle$}C and power loss at the tube body did not exceed 10 kW, the interlock level for the protection of the klystron.

  abstract = {Low-loss circular waveguides will be needed for a large number of millimeter-wave transmission lines on ITER, including those transmitting electron cyclotron power and diagnostic signals. In order to provide lowloss transmission, the waveguides need to be several wavelengths in diameter. Corrugating the walls reduces the loss further not only in straight runs but also at bends, and makes the waveguide robust against small deformations. We present results of theoretical calculations showing that these properties can be maintained over very wide bandwidths suitable for ITER applications. The computer code used to make these calculations is based on a space-harmonic analysis of the fields. Measurements on waveguides are described that validate the theory for corrugated waveguides semiquantitatively. Tolerances on the corrugation geometry, waveguide bore, waveguide junctions, input Gaussian beam alignment, and waveguide support alignment are discussed. It is shown that the low-loss properties of corrugated waveguide are insensitive to many variations in geometry and deviations from ideality. Finally, some fabrication considerations are presented. In order to provide more complete coverage of the waveguides themselves, only brief mention is made of the losses due to input coupling and components such as bends. Some review material and some level of technical detail are both presented.},

For a specified final energy, the gradient sets the accelerator length, and for a given accelerating structure (and pulse repetition rate) it determines the power consumption. Accelerating gradients in the order of 100 MV/m have been reached in short (/spl sim/ 20 cm) standing wave and traveling wave X-band accelerating structures. But, recent experiments have shown damage to traveling wave accelerating structures at gradients as low as 50 MV/m after 1000 hours of operation. RF breakdown is a probable cause of this damage. An extensive experimental and theoretical program to determine a safe operating gradient for the Next Linear Collider (NLC) is under way in SLAC. The present work is a part of that program.},

The impact of plasma operations such as plasma initiation, long plasma discharges, and disruption is given in detail, highlighting their impact on cryogenics, which remains in all cases weak. The fast safety discharges (FSDs) of the system can disturb normal operation. Origin of and statistics about FSDs are discussed, detailing efforts to decrease their number. Finally, maintenance and monitoring of the cryogenic system and of the various sensors are presented with some consideration regarding the aging of the system and its overall availability. Details are given regarding minor failures on components all along the operation. Overall, the accumulated experience is certainly a useful tool to prepare the manufacture and operation of the ITER superconducting magnets despite the differences in design and size.},

  abstract = {Magnetic fusion plasmas feature two major classes of low frequency electromagnetic oscillations: waves in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRFs) constitute a well established method employed for plasma heating and current drive, whereas waves in the Alfve\textasciiacute n range of frequencies naturally occur in the form of modes in close interaction with fast particles. The propagation of these waves is characterized by significant space-dispersion, making it necessary to incorporate non-local effects in the global kinetic full-wave codes which are often employed for their simulation. We present here a variational approach to this problem, which has the advantage of providing a common framework to the wave calculation and to the quasilinear response description. Two important points are discussed: firstly, we show that the irreversible part of the power transferred from the wave to the plasma particles is directly available and does not require an explicit evaluation of the kinetic flux; secondly, it is demonstrated that the symmetry of the obtained plasma functional ensures that these energy transfers are described in a consistent fashion, regardless of the level of approximation employed to evaluate the particle Hamiltonian. Finally, quasi-local, finite Larmor radius expressions are derived in the framework of this formalism and implemented in a new multi-dimensional full-wave code, named EVE, which is employed to analyse two ICRF heating scenarios for ITER.},

These waves can also be used to drive current by direct electron damping of the fast wave, provided an appropriate antenna phasing is used. The corresponding current profile is peaked near the magnetic axis, and can have a beneficial effect on the discharge stability and performance. In this paper, two scenarios applicable during the activated phase of ITER operation are compared: second harmonic tritium heating and minority helium-3 heating, which differ in the addition of a small fraction of 3He ions (2\%) in the DT mixture for the latter. The resulting change of the dominant ICRF heating scheme causes the discharge properties to differ appreciably. In this paper, a full-wave code is coupled to a Fokker\textendash Planck solver and a current drive module to investigate in detail the effect of ICRF waves on the discharge. The impact of phasing on the scenario in terms of plasma heating and current drive efficiency is studied by simulating ICRF heating with various antenna toroidal spectra. It is found that despite a lower current drive efficiency, the addition of 3He in the discharge increases the single-pass absorption rate, the ion heating fraction, and makes the scenario essentially immune to details in the toroidal phasing and fast ion properties.},

  abstract = {Integrating several important technological elements required for long pulse operation in magnetic fusion devices, the Tore Supra tokamak routinely addresses the physics and technology issues related to this endeavor and, as a result, contributes essential information on critical issues for ITER. During the last experimental campaign, components of the radiofrequency system including an ITER relevant launcher (passive active multijunction (PAM)) and continuous wave/3.7 GHz klystrons, have been extensively qualified, and then used to develop steady state scenarios in which the lower hybrid (LH), ion cyclotron (IC) and electron cyclotron (EC) systems have been combined in fully stationary shots (duration {$\sim$}150 s, injected power up to {$\sim$}8 MW, injected/extracted energy up to {$\sim$}1 GJ). Injection of LH power in the 5.0\textendash 6.0 MW range has extended the domain of accessible plasma parameters to higher densities and non-inductive currents. These discharges exhibit steady electron internal transport barriers (ITBs). We report here on various issues relevant to the steady state operation of future devices, ranging from operational aspects and limitations related to the achievement of long pulses in a fully actively cooled fusion device (e.g. overheating due to fast particle losses), to more fundamental plasma physics topics. The latter include a beneficial influence of IC resonance heating on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability in these discharges, which has been studied in detail. Another interesting observation is the appearance of oscillations of the central temperature with typical periods of the order of one to several seconds, caused by a nonlinear interplay between LH deposition, MHD activity and bootstrap current in the presence of an ITB.},

Dedicated measurements on a RF test-stand were made in order to characterize the optical signature of RF arcs (time and spectrum) to assess the potential of optical arc detection on ICRF systems. Time-resolved intensity measurements were carried out using high-speed Si photodetectors with different bandpass filters. The rise time of the arc emission, the light intensity and the time evolution of the arc under different pressure conditions are discussed. Spectral signature of the arcs was obtained using spectrometers in the visible and UV range. It is shown that the arc emission spectrum is independent of the gas pressure and that it is mainly dominated by the stainless steel components of the test bench. The results of the RF arc optical characterization is discussed with a view on the implementation of an optical arc detection system for an ICRF antenna on a fusion machine, both for sections viewing the plasma light as for private vacuum sections.},

A description of the LHCD system is given, including the different launcher designs developed for the Tore Supra long-pulse program. Following the completion of the Composants Internes et Limiteur project, together with the installation of a high-performance LHCD launcher, world record discharges, injected and extracted energy exceeding 1 GJ, were obtained in 2003. With the flexibility of lower hybrid (LH) waves to tailor the current profile, an enhanced performance regime, the so-called LHEP, has been maintained in quasi-steady-state discharges. Detailed measurements of the fast electron distribution have allowed us to constrain LHCD ray-tracing models and to quantify parametric dependencies describing the fast electron tail. Localized heat loads on the LHCD launchers due to interaction with fast particles have been measured and quantified, using infrared imaging and calorimetric measurements on water-cooled plasma facing components. Furthermore, experimental results in the area of LH wave coupling are presented.},

  abstract = {A new ITER-relevant lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) launcher, based on the passive-active-multijunction (PAM) concept, was brought into operation on the Tore Supra tokamak in autumn 2009. The PAM launcher concept was designed in view of ITER to allow efficient cooling of the waveguides, as required for long pulse operation. In addition, it offers low power reflection close to the cut-off density, which is very attractive for ITER, where the large distance between the plasma and the wall may bring the density in front of the launcher to low values. The first experimental campaign on Tore Supra has shown extremely encouraging results in terms of reflected power level and power handling. Power reflection coefficient {$<$}2\% is obtained at low density in front of the launcher, i.e. close to the cut-off density, and very good agreement between the experimental results and the coupling code predictions is obtained. Long pulse operation at ITER-relevant power density has been demonstrated. The maximum power and energy reached so far is 2.7 MW during 78 s, corresponding to a power density of 25 MW m-2, i.e. its design value at f = 3.7 GHz. In addition, 2.7 MW has been coupled at a plasma\textendash launcher distance of 10 cm, with a power reflection coefficient {$<$}2\%. Finally, full non-inductive discharges have been sustained for 50 s with the PAM.},

The discharge can occur for a wide range of frequencies, from the MHz range to tens of GHz, and in wide array of geometries if the impacted surface has a secondary electron emission (SEE) yield larger than one. The discharge can take place on a single surface or between two surfaces. A novel coaxial resonator to investigate two-surface multipactor discharges on metal and dielectric surfaces in the gap region under high vacuum (HV) conditions (10-8 mbar) has been developed and tested at LAL. The RF coaxial resonator is {$\sim$}19~cm in length with an outer diameter of 11~cm. A pulsed RF source delivers up to 30 W average power over a wide frequency range 650\textendash 900 MHz to the RF resonator. The incident and reflected RF signals are monitored by calibrated RF diodes. An electron probe provides temporal measurements of the multipacting electron current with respect to the RF power. These experiments were successful in identifying multipacting and allowed us the evaluation of a home made sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin layers as a Multipactor suppressor.},

Nuclear fusion offers significant benefits in comparison with exploited energy sources, especially limitless fuel reserves, inherent nuclear safety, and negligible impact on the environment. The challenge is a high heat and neutron loading of the fusion reactors nuclear zone. The paper brings the ex-ante economic analysis of the fusion power plant model DEMO2 in terms of the cost of electricity. The model investment and operating costs are presented. The limit sales price of electricity was found using the net present value method. The levelized cost of electricity LCOE method with the inclusion of external costs is used for a comparison of selected power plant types based on the OECD statistical data and the EU ExternE project results. The comparison shows the levelized cost of electricity of fusion power plants competitive to the actual renewable resources. After internalisation of external costs, the fusion power plants should become even the second cheapest power source.},

First, in order to avoid introducing ambiguities, frequency dispersion in materials has to be clearly defined from first principles; in both intrinsic and effective forms. Different frequency dispersion models are then introduced for `metal-like' materials. To act as benchmark structures, conventional air-filled metal-pipe rectangular waveguides, associated cavity resonators and a spoof surface plasmon waveguide have been simulated, using a raft of different approaches; with a view to illustrating quantifiable weaknesses in commercial software packages for simulating arbitrary metal-based THz structures. This paper highlights intuitive and logical approaches that give incorrect results and, where possible, makes recommendations for the most appropriate solutions that have hitherto not been given in Technical Notes.},

Even with no current load, voltage withstand can be compromised when contacts are simply closed and then reopened, through cold weld effects and mechanical disturbance of the interrupter. For contacts carrying high current when closed, additional effects associated with Joule heating at the contact interface become important while interruption at both low and high currents substantially broaden the range of physical phenomena contributing to dielectric failure. More generally, any of the principal components of interrupter construction, i.e. contact supports, contacts, shields, and envelope, as well as the motion and force imparted to the moving contact, can limit significantly the withstand capability of interrupting devices. Further limitations of electrical performance are imposed by particle effects. This paper reviews such phenomena.},

The objectives of the REC activity are to identify the functions and solve the technical issues for the construction of the REC for ITER at Rokkasho, and to develop the remote experiment system and verify the functions required for remote experimentation by using the Satellite Tokamak (JT-60SA) facilities to facilitate the future exploitation of ITER and JT-60SA. The functions of REC will be tested, and the total system will be demonstrated using JT-60SA and existing facilities in the EU, such as JET and WEST. The hardware of the REC has been prepared in Rokkasho Japan, which has the remote experiment room with a large video wall to show the plasma and operation status, IT equipment and a storage system by the reuse of the Helios supercomputer tape library. A broadband network infrastructure of 10Gbps has been installed connected to SINET5. Using this network system, fast data transfer from ITER to REC was examined in 2016, and the transfer of the data volumes expected for the initial ITER experiments has been demonstrated. A secure remote experimentation system has been developed, using JT-60SA, that has functions for preparing and setting of shot parameters, viewing the status of control data, streaming of the plasma status, data-exchange function of shot events, and monitoring of the facility operation. Remote data analysis techniques, data visualisation software, a documentation management and experiment planning system and numerical simulation codes for the preparation and performance estimation of discharges have also been developed.},

  abstract = {This chapter reviews the progress accomplished since the redaction of the first ITER Physics Basis (1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2137\textendash 664) in the field of energetic ion physics and its possible impact on burning plasma regimes. New schemes to create energetic ions simulating the fusion-produced alphas are introduced, accessing experimental conditions of direct relevance for burning plasmas, in terms of the Alfv\'enic Mach number and of the normalised pressure gradient of the energetic ions, though orbit characteristics and size cannot always match those of ITER. Based on the experimental and theoretical knowledge of the effects of the toroidal magnetic field ripple on direct fast ion losses, ferritic inserts in ITER are expected to provide a significant reduction of ripple alpha losses in reversed shear configurations. The nonlinear fast ion interaction with kink and tearing modes is qualitatively understood, but quantitative predictions are missing, particularly for the stabilisation of sawteeth by fast particles that can trigger neoclassical tearing modes. A large database on the linear stability properties of the modes interacting with energetic ions, such as the Alfv\'en eigenmode has been constructed. Comparisons between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of mode structures and drive/damping rates approach a satisfactory degree of consistency, though systematic measurements and theory comparisons of damping and drive of intermediate and high mode numbers, the most relevant for ITER, still need to be performed. The nonlinear behaviour of Alfv\'en eigenmodes close to marginal stability is well characterized theoretically and experimentally, which gives the opportunity to extract some information on the particle phase space distribution from the measured instability spectral features. Much less data exists for strongly unstable scenarios, characterised by nonlinear dynamical processes leading to energetic ion redistribution and losses, and identified in nonlinear numerical simulations of Alfv\'en eigenmodes and energetic particle modes. Comparisons with theoretical and numerical analyses are needed to assess the potential implications of these regimes on burning plasma scenarios, including in the presence of a large number of modes simultaneously driven unstable by the fast ions.},

Those measurements include the losses of the transmission line and the antenna. An approach to separate the radiated power from the losses is to measure the current in the antenna loops. To measure the current in the short of the antenna loop two current probes have been installed near the short of the antenna loops in one of the ICRF antennas during the 2009/2010 shutdown of ASDEX Upgrade. These signals allow a new approach in calculating the antenna resistance and the launched power and can be used to separate the launched power from the losses in the matching system and transmission lines up to the antenna. Although the calibration of the signal amplitude from the current probes needs further investigation, the amplitude is proportional to the current in the antenna loop. With those probes and a new real-time DSP-based system, the radiated (as opposed to the total power i.e. including loss power) power can be feedback controlled.},

The classical wave theory of light is derived from these laws for the case in which temporal variation of path amplitudes may be neglected, whereas specific experiments, sensitive to the temporal properties of path amplitudes, are suggested. The reflection coefficient of light from the surface of a transparent medium is found to be markedly different to that predicted by the classical Fresnel formula.

Multipactor-induced breakdowns can be critical to microwave systems in space communication payloads or in experimental fusion devices. Multipactor simulations can be used to predict power thresholds but the results highly depend on the electron emission properties of the RF component materials. Moreover, in both space and fusion applications, the RF devices can be subjected to DC magnetic fields. This magnetic field may affect the electron emission properties. In order to improve understanding and predictability of the multipactor effect, the assessment of DC magnetic field on the electron emission properties is required; an experimental setup has been developed to measure the Total Electron Emission Yield (TEEY) under DC magnetic field. The aim of this paper is to describe the newly developed experimental setup and the associated TEEY measurements techniques. The effect of DC magnetic field on the TEEY of copper is investigated.},

  abstract = {Multipactor is a resonance effect between the RF electric field and the motion of the electrons which can decrease the performance of Radio-Frequency (RF) systems functioning under vacuum [1]. It highly depends on the electron emission properties of the RF component materials. Applications using these kind of components are telecommunication satellite [2], fusion experimental reactors with Tokamak [3] or particle accelerators [4] among others. Many experimental [5] and theoretical [6]\textendash [9] works have been conducted to study this undesirable phenomenon. The aim of these approaches is to determine the multipactor power threshold. Above this threshold, multipactor can appears and eventually damage RF systems. In some applications concerned by the multipactor effect, RF components are submitted to DC magnetic fields. For instance, in telecommunication satellite, magnetic fields of a few tenths of Tesla produced with permanent magnets are used in circulators and isolators. In fusion reactors, rectangular copper waveguides are located under intense magnetic fields of few Tesla generated by toroidal and poloidal coils. Multipactor simulations codes are used to calculate the threshold that would trigger the electron density growth by following the electrons under the RF wave electromagnetic field [7], [8]. Multipactor modeling can also take into account an external magnetic field, which induces gyratory motions of electrons within the simulated RF structure. Studies have been made on the effect of external magnetic field on multipactor discharge [10]. However, to our knowledge, there are no multipactor simulation codes which consider the influence of DC magnetic field on the electron emission process itself. Electron emission due to an incident electron beam is a phenomenon which lies on the surface first tens of nanometer [11]. Then the Total Electron Emission Yield (TEEY) highly depends on surface condition (topography, contaminants adsorbed) and surface treatment (drying, irradiation, erosion) [11]\textendash [15]. The presence of a uniform DC magnetic field influences the electrons trajectories by giving them cylindrical helix trajectories depending on the direction of the magnetic field as well as on the energy of the electrons. To study the effect of the magnetic field on the TEEY, a new experimental setup has been developed. A special attention to the design of the experimental setup and to the choice of the measurement methodology has been taken to circumvent the possible artefacts that are related to the high sensitivity of incoming and emitted electrons trajectories to the DC magnetic field. The new developed experimental setup and the measurement methods are described in details in [16] as well as the validation procedure of the TEEY measurement methodology based on both experiments and modelling with SPIS code [17]. In this paper TEEY measurements on copper under a DC magnetic field perpendicular to the sample surface are presented. We have studied various surface morphologies such as laminated and polished and have observed TEEY increase as well as decrease depending on the magnetic field amplitude and the surface morphology [18]. With incident electron at first cross-over energy (EC1), DC magnetic field has a greater influence on the laminate surface than the polished one (respectively TEEY decreased to 45\% and 5\%). Such impact of the magnetic field is discussed in regards of multipactor effect simulations codes.},

The code PFCFlux (Plasma Facing Components Flux) has been developed for heat flux calculations on those components, including shadowing effects. It has been implemented at JET, for the evaluation of the power deposition on the poloidal limiters (high and low field sides) and the divertor targets. In this paper, the concepts and methodology used are described. Two cases are then analysed, one of which is compared with infrared measurements and probes measurements. The usages of the tool are discussed, as well as the need of ``end-to-end'' simulation composed of several simulations tools in order to correctly predict the measurement itself.},

  abstract = {Fast electrons generated in front of lower hybrid (LH) grills can cause damage to tokamak divertor and first wall components. It is therefore of interest to identify possible edge electron acceleration mechanisms and suggest measures to limit these. One possible acceleration process described here depends on mode overlap in the antenna electric field spectrum and on the presence of high-n modes, resonant with the ambient ({$\sim$}25 eV) edge electrons. These electrons then diffuse throughout the globally stochastic region of n -space whose upper bound is given by the last overlapping mode. It is shown that the described acceleration is seriously aggravated by the presence of higher order waveguide modes generated at sharp waveguide\textendash plasma transitions and that rounding-off the waveguide septa can considerably reduce the fields and electron acceleration associated with these higher order modes. Additional antenna field non-uniformities arising from a grill modular structure and random fields generated at the plasma edge through parametric decay and scattering of the LH slow wave from plasma density fluctuations can further enhance the edge electron energy.},

Only for (0, 0) phasing and less than 30 mm of the distance between the outermost magnetic surface and the antenna guard limiter, the radiation loss increases abruptly from {$\Delta$}PradPIC {$\sim$} 0.3 to {$\Delta$}PradPIC {$\sim$} 4 in carbon limiter discharges when the injected power exceeds a threshold value of {$\sim$} 0.5 MW. Strong titanium impurity release from the Faraday shield is observed in coincidence with the increase in the radiation loss.

This radiation is potentially harmful for any object made of RF-absorbing material exposed to it. Special material or/and suitable techniques to scrambling the radiation could be needed, depending on the effective expected level of such radiation. Therefore arises the need for a reliable method to foresee the distribution and the level of the RF-stray radiation. A multi-modal antenna, with sensitivity approximately constant for any incoming linear polarization, with great radiating surface and low directivity has been developed. Its purpose is collecting 140 GHz stray radiation from FTU tokamak and Wendelstein 7-AS stellarator plasmas during ECRH and current drive experiments. Theoretical predictions for stray radiation levels are obtained by two different methods: a multiple ray tracing code developed for FTU and a multi-cell code, originally written for W7-X. Both codes have been applied to FTU geometry, resulting in a good agreement with the experimental data from the multi-modal antenna. Descriptions of the antenna design and of the results from both codes are presented. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

A representative configuration of both the antenna and the DEMO reactor was used together with a parametric analysis for the parameters that most strongly affect the TBR. These are the type of breeding blanket (Helium Cooled Pebble Bed, Helium Cooled Lithium Lead and Water Cooled Lithium Lead), the covering ratio of the straps of the antenna (the ratio between the surface of all the straps and the projected surface of the antenna slot: 0.49, 0.72 and 0.94), the depth of the antenna (20 cm and 40 cm), the thickness of the straps (2 cm, 4 cm and a double layer of 0.2 cm plus 2.5 cm with the composition of the First Wall), and finally the poloidal position of the antenna (0\textordmasculine, which is the equatorial port, 40\textordmasculine{} and 90\textordmasculine, which is the upper port). For an antenna with a full toroidal circumference of 360\textordmasculine, located poloidaly at 40\textordmasculine{} with a poloidal extension of 1 m and a total First Wall surface of 67 m2, the reduction of the TBR is -0.35\% for a HCPB blanket concept, -0.53\% for a HCLL blanket concept and -0.51\% for a WCLL blanket concept. In all cases, covered by the parametric analysis, the loss of TBR remains above than -0.61\%. Such a distributed ICRF antenna has thus only a marginal effect on the TBR for a DEMO reactor.},

It is shown that, in some materials and some neutron spectra, transmutation can significantly affect or even dominate a given property change process. When the process under study is also sensitive to displacement rate, and especially if it involves radiationinduced segregation and precipitation, it becomes much more difficult to separate the transmutation and displacement rate dependencies. This complicates the application of data derived from "surrogate" spectra to predictions in other flux-spectra environments. It is also shown in this paper that one must be sensitive to the impact of previously-ignored "small" variations in neutron spectra within a given reactor. In some materials these small variations have major consequences.},

On Alcator C-Mod, a new magnetic field-aligned antenna was optimized for magnetic flux coupling, power handling, and minimized integrated parallel electric field (E ). Initial simulations performed using both slab and cylindrical geometry suggested nearly complete cancellation of E in front of the antenna structure for certain toroidal phasings. Using toroidal models, the cancellation of E is more modest, suggesting 3-D geometrical effects are important. Using finite element method simulations with a 3-D toroidal cold plasma model, multiple antenna phases were analyzed: [0, , 0, ], [0, 0, , ], [0, , , 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, /6, 0, /6], and [0, /2, , 3 /2].

  abstract = {The propagation equation, written in a curvilinear coordinate system, is solved by using a perturbation method inspired by quantum physics. The parameter of perturbation is the groove depth which is small compared to the period. The method is expanded up to second order for the non-degenerate problem. In this way the solutions have analytical form compared to a numerical method. They present the advantage of providing evidence for the evolution of the energy distribution for different diffraction orders as a function of the magnitude of the perturbation. The results that are deduced from these analytical solutions are within less than 5 \texttimes{} 10-3 of those obtained by the curvilinear coordinate method. Thus, this new approach opens a new range of applications for inverse problems.},

  abstract = {The French Tore Supra tokamak is upgraded in an x-point divertor fusion device in the frame of the WEST (W-for tungsten-Environment in Steady-state Tokamak) project, launched in support to the ITER tungsten divertor strategy. The WEST project aims to test actively cooled tungsten Plasma Facing Components (PFC) under long plasma discharge. As the existing cooling loop B30 cannot ensure the cooling of the W divertor elements under ITER nominal conditions, a new pressurized water loop must be designed to exhaust all the heat coming from the plasma and transmitted to the in-vessel components. It includes additional piping networks of around 50m3 connected to the existing loop in order to cool components such as stainless steel vessel protection panels, upper and lower divertor coper coils, baffle, bumpers and ripple protection. During plasma operation, the water inlet temperature is 70 \textdegree C and the pressure at the inlet of the pump is 2.4 MPa while baking is performed at 200 \textdegree C and 2MPa to achieve the outgassing of components inside the vacuum vessel. As the pressure drop of the divertor coils is higher than the pressure drop of the other PFCs, the cooling of these coils is ensured by an independent water loop with a new centrifugal pump. This paper presents the design and thermomechanical analysis of this system including piping stress and supports analysis according to CODETI standards.},

A comparison between the simulation results and the experimental observations for the installed CESR-III SRF systems was made. Measures to suppress multipactoring were explored. Our simulation results suggested that an external DC magnetic field of a few Gauss of amplitude in the wave propagation direction would be very effective in disturbing the trajectories.

The diagnostics system of Tore Supra consists of roughly 30 diagnostics, covering a large range of plasma parameters from the core to the edge.

  abstract = {The starting field strength of an electrodeless discharge in a uniform high-frequency electric field at pressures of order 10-3 mm. Hg in helium, mercury, hydrogen, and air, is found to be independent of the gas and only slightly dependent on its pressure. By increasing the wavelength ({$>$} 4 m.) the starting field varies first inversely with the wave-length, then becomes constant, and at a critical value rises discontinuously probably to infinity. This cut-off wavelength is proportional to the diameter of spherical and the length of cylindrical vessels respectively, the axis of the cylinder being parallel to the field. The facts that the results are independent of the gas and that at these pressures the electrons collide very rarely with gas molecules both indicate that directionization by collision with the gas cannot account for the multiplication of the few electrons originally present. A theory is worked out on the basis that secondary emission from the walls is the operative factor. The initial electrons assumed to move singly in vacuum come to life at various phase angles of the alternating field. However, only those contribute effectively to the multiplication process whose transit time between the walls corresponds to one or an odd number of half-cycles, and whose velocity is large enough to liberate from the wall more than one secondary electron. For each phase angle an appropriate transit time, that is, an appropriate wave-length, can be found to give this requisite final velocity so that discharges are possible over a limited range of wave-lengths corresponding to the allowable phase angles. From similarity follows the proportionality between cut-off wave-length and the size of the vessel. This theory agrees well with the experimental results. The dependence on secondary emission was confirmed because by coating the inner glass wall with a poor secondary emitter the starting field is increased, while the cut-off wave-length decreases; the reverse is observed when clear Pyrex glass is exchanged for soda glass, which agrees with the larger value of the coefficient of secondary emission of the latter.},

The limitations, in particular in H-mode plasmas, are discussed and the performance compared with other LHCD experiments using multijunctions as power dividers. Although the power density of 25 MW m-2 has been exceeded in L-mode and almost obtained in ELMy H-mode (on 1/6th of the antenna), it is concluded that the RF conditioning performed on JET does not allow us to exceed an electric field of {$\sim$}5.5 kV cm-1 which is generally not sufficient under the rather weak coupling conditions of the JET H-mode. Modelling of an arc occurring in a waveguide indicates that rather small variations of the reflected wave (amplitude and phase) may occur, rendering arc detection based on RF measurements difficult in some cases. The JET bolometry diagnostic with four chords viewing the antenna front is found to be an efficient tool to detect an arc. In L-mode plasmas, a very good correlation between the amplitude of the bolometry signals and the iron spectroscopic lines is found. In H-mode the arc detection is clearly more difficult with enhanced radiation during the ELM but is still possible when the bolometry signals are properly processed.},

  abstract = {Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) experiments with line-averaged density varying between 1.5 \texttimes{} 1019 and 6 \texttimes{} 1019 m-3 are performed on the Tore Supra tokamak under quasi-steady-state conditions with respect to the fast electron dynamics. The LHCD efficiency is analysed from the fast electron bremsstrahlung (FEB) and electron cyclotron emission (ECE). The effect of plasma equilibrium and particle fuelling is documented. It is concluded that the fast decay of FEB with plasma density could be consistent with simple scaling of the current drive efficiency and FEB. Plasma edge measurements are presented looking for the effect on fast electron emission. In a specific case of particle fuelling, an anomalous decay of the hard x-ray and ECE signals suggests deleterious interaction of the wave with edge plasma.},

  abstract = {Multipactor, the well-known electron avalanche phenomena occurring in waveguides when the amplitude of the RF electric field exceeds a threshold, is modelled for lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) antennas. The electric field threshold departures significantly from the expected linear scaling with the frequency when the width of the waveguide along the electric field increases. For 5 GHz waveguides, the multipactor does not occur when this width exceeds 26 mm, in very good agreement with analytical formulation. Effect of static magnetic field with typical values of tokamak environment is examined. It is found that the threshold is weakly reduced (-6\%) for the front face of the antenna featuring the rows of narrow waveguides. Strong reduction in the threshold is found where the wave frequency equals the electron cyclotron frequency (0.178 T at 5 GHz) but this condition will not be met on ITER. After baking at 240 {$\smwhtcircle$}C, wide waveguides at the antenna input (29 mm on ITER) have a threshold of {$\sim$}7 kV cm-1, assuming a homogeneous magnetic field. However, preliminary results indicate higher threshold when the gradient of the magnetic field along the waveguide is taken into account and no limitation, from this section, is expected for the ITER LHCD antenna.},

However, silver's poor mechanical performance, due to its lack of hardness and susceptibility to surface tarnishing, has limited silver's applications to connector systems that require low durability and high contact normal forces, such as power connectors. This paper will present the material properties and results from reliability testing for a new electroplated nano-crystalline, cyanide free, silver alloy on a nickel barrier layer, that can be considered as an alternative finish for hard gold traditionally found in the separable interfaces of high signal density, electrical interconnect systems. The study shows the new silver alloy technology stack presented in this paper provides improvements to its mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties such that, in conjunction with the mechanical properties of the nickel corrosion barrier, should enable the technology stack to meet the performance requirements in accordance with the Telcordia GR-1217-CORE specification and EIA-364 test procedures.},

The plasma density and its gradient at the mouth of the grill are estimated from probe measurements made with plasma conditions similar to those of the experimental coupling data. The qualitative agreement is always very good and a quantitative agreement is obtained in a relatively high density regime. The validity of the step density model is supported by the density dependence of the phases of the reflected signals.},

Results obtained using the conventional matching (stubs and trombones) system, 3 dB couplers and the conjugate-T scheme with variable matching elements outside the wave launching structure (external conjugate-T) and inside the wave launching structure (ITER-like antenna) are described. The presence of the three different approaches to load resilient ICRF systems at JET creates a unique opportunity to compare these methods under very similar plasma conditions and to assess the results of ICRF power delivery to ELMy plasmas, an important issue for ITER. The impact of the availability of increased levels of reliable ICRF power on plasma physics studies in JET is illustrated.},

The software has been designed for the needs of W7-X researchers and engineers: a web-based logbook application for the entire team. For an effective documentation, large parts of the logbook content comes from automatically generated logs, complemented by the team members via web browser or REST API. The W7-X control software generates log entries for an XP during program execution. This includes automatic extraction of configuration information from the planned program, which is later represented as searchable tags within the logbook. In addition, users can add supplementary tags and rich-text comments to all logs. The logbook allows full-text search and range queries for numeric values: both with millisecond response times. A dedicated web page for each XP log contains overview plots from measurement data, generated on the fly from archived data. Separate component logs are created in the same way for diagnostics and machine sub-systems for different use cases, e.g., XPs, standalone tests, or calibrations. The logbook hosts separate pages for device operation and the W7-X components, providing status information and additional features. In this way it effectively supports the operation of W7-X.},

  abstract = {A multipactor discharge is a resonant condition for electrons in an alternating electric field. This discharge can be disruptive to radio frequency (RF) circuits, cavities, and resonators. The Coaxial Multipactor Experiment (CMX) investigates these discharges in parallel plate and coaxial transmission line geometries at frequencies from 40 to 150 MHz with goals of measuring the electron energy distributions. CMX has a unique experimental setup which allows the transmission line to pass continuously through a short vacuum region. Retarding potential analyzers with secondary electron suppression measure the electron current as a function of bias voltage. Both parallel plate and coaxial multipactor experiments provide the first detailed measurements of the electron energy distributions under a variety of RF frequencies and electrode materials.},

  abstract = {While the results of early work on the density limit in tokamaks from the ORMAK and DITE groups have been useful over the years, results from recent experiments and the requirements for extrapolation to future experiments have prompted a new look at this subject. There are many physical processes which limit the attainable densities in tokamak plasmas. These processes include: (1) radiation from low Z impurities, convection, charge exchange and other losses at the plasma edge; (2) radiation from low or high Z impurities in the plasma core; (3) deterioration of particle confinement in the plasma core; and (4) inadequate fuelling, often exacerbated by strong pumping by walls, limiters or divertors. Depending upon the circumstances, any of these processes may dominate and determine a density limit. In general, these mechanisms do not show the same dependence on plasma parameters. The multiplicity of processes leading to density limits with a variety of scaling has led to some confusion when comparing density limits for different machines. The authors attempt to sort out the various limits and to extend the scaling law for one of them to include the important effects of plasma shaping, i.e. rfe = KJ, where ne is the line average electron density (1020 m\textasciitilde 3), K is the plasma elongation and T(MA-m\textasciitilde 2) is the average plasma current density, defined as the total current divided by the plasma cross-sectional area. In a sense, this is the most important density limit since, together with the q-limit, it yields the maximum operating density for a tokamak plasma. It is shown that this limit may be caused by a dramatic deterioration in core particle confinement occurring as the density limit boundary is approached. This mechanism can help explain the disruptions and Marfes that are associated with the density limit.},

  abstract = {The ITER plasma control system has the same functional scope as the control systems in present tokamaks. These are plasma operation scenario sequencing, plasma basic control (magnetic and kinetic), plasma advanced control (control of RWMs, NTMs, ELMs, error fields, etc) and plasma fast shutdown. This chapter considers only plasma initiation and plasma basic control. This chapter describes the progress achieved in these areas in the tokamak experiments since the ITER Physics Basis (1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2577) was written and the results of assessment of ITER to provide the plasma initiation and basic control. This assessment was done for the present ITER design (15 MA machine) at a more detailed level than it was done for the ITER design 1998 (21 MA machine) described in the ITER Physics Basis (1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2577). The experiments on plasma initiation performed in DIII-D and JT-60U, as well as the theoretical studies performed for ITER, have demonstrated that, within specified assumptions on the plasma confinement and the impurity influx, ITER can produce plasma initiation in a low toroidal electric field (0.3 V m-1), if it is assisted by about 2 MW of ECRF heating. The plasma basic control includes control of the plasma current, position and shape\textemdash the plasma magnetic control, as well as control of other plasma global parameters or their profiles\textemdash the plasma performance control. The magnetic control is based on more reliable and simpler models of the control objects than those available at present for the plasma kinetic control. Moreover the real time diagnostics used for the magnetic control in many cases are more precise than those used for the kinetic control. Because of these reasons, the plasma magnetic control was developed for modern tokamaks and assessed for ITER better than the kinetic control. However, significant progress has been achieved in the plasma performance control during the last few years. Although the physics basis of plasma operation and control is similar in ITER and present tokamaks, there is a principal qualitative difference. To minimize its cost, ITER has been designed with small margins in many plasma and engineering parameters. These small margins result in a significantly narrower operational space compared with present tokamaks. Furthermore, ITER operation is expensive and component damage resulting from purely operational errors might lead to a high and avoidable repair cost. These factors make it judicious to use validated plasma diagnostics and employ simulators to `pre-test' the combined ITER operation and control systems. Understanding of how to do this type of pre-test validation is now developed in present day experiments. This research push should provide us with fully functional simulators before the first ITER operation.},

  abstract = {This year, TORE-SUPRA celebrated 25 years of operation. During this time, a number of technologies have been developed. First of all, it was mandatory to develop reliable superconducting magnets at {$\sim$}1.8 K, with superfluid helium as an efficient coolant. For the production of steady-state discharge, three types of radio-frequency (RF) additional heating systems have been developed: lower hybrid current drive, ions and electrons cyclotron resonance heating. To cope with long-lasting discharges (up to 380 s\texttimes 2.8 MW) and large RF additional heating power (12.3 MW\texttimes 3 s), actively cooled (AC) plasma facing components were deployed in TORE-SUPRA for the first time in a tokamak environment. TORE-SUPRA is now being modified into a D-shaped axisymmetric tokamak with AC main chamber walls and an AC tungsten divertor, the W\textemdash for tungsten\textemdash Environment in Steady-state tokamak (WEST). This new facility has the objective to offer ITER a test bed for validating the relevant AC metallic technologies in D-shaped H-mode plasmas. In contrast to other metallic devices such as JET and ASDEX upgrade, WEST will rely only on RF additional power systems. A set of plasma scenarios have been identified, ranging from a high total RF power scenario up to 15 MW\textendash 30 s, to a high fluence scenario of 1000 s with up to 10 MW of injected RF power. These scenarios are able to reproduce ITER-relevant conditions of steady-state heat loads of 10\textendash 20 MW/m2, to test tungsten AC divertor technologies with relevant power heat fluxes and particle fluence.},

We report on the first measurements of both the energy from 0 to 1 keV and the radial-poloidal distributions of the accelerated electrons using a retarding field analyzer. Two distinct electron populations are present : a cold, thermal population with temperatures between 10 and 30 eV, and a suprathermal component. Only partial attenuation of the electron flux was achieved at maximum applied voltage, indicating energies greater than 1 keV. Detailed 2D mapping of the hot spots was obtained by varying the safety factor stepwise during a single discharge. The radial width of the suprathermal electron beam at full power is rather large, at least about 5-6 cm, in contrast to Landau damping theory of the launched wave that predicts the radial width of the hot spots should not exceed a few millimetres [2]. The electron flux far from the grill is intermittent, with a typical burst rate of the order of 10 kHz.},

Many new and exciting physics results have been obtained in the quest for long-pulse operations. The key findings are as follows: (1) access to H-modes in EAST favours the divertor configuration with the ion {$\nabla$}B drift directed away from the dominant X-point; (2) divertor asymmetry during edgelocalized modes (ELMs) also appears to be dependent on the toroidal field direction, with preferential particle flow opposite to the ion {$\nabla$}B drift; (3) LHCD induces a striated heat flux (SHF), enhancing heat deposition away from the strike point, and the degree of SHF can be modified by supersonic molecule beam injection; (4) the long-pulse H-modes in EAST exhibit a confinement quality between type-I and type-III ELMy H-modes, with H98(y,2) {$\sim$} 0.9, similar to type-II ELMy H-modes.},

  abstract = {Glow discharge cleaning (GDC) is a common technique for the conditioning of tokamak vessel walls in order to improve plasma performance and will be one of the primary conditioning techniques in ITER. The GDC discharge is a dc low-temperature plasma discharge, operated in the absence of the toroidal magnetic field, between one or more anodes inserted into the vessel, and the entire vessel wall serving as a cathode. This paper presents a self-consistent twodimensional model of the GDC discharge with the aim of improving fundamental understanding and predicting the wall ion current density distribution in ITER. The model combines a standard fluid model of the quasineutral plasma bulk with non-standard fluid equations for the fast electrons accelerated by the cathode sheath, based on transport coefficients and rate coefficients deduced from a Monte Carlo simulation. Examples of model results are shown in order to illustrate the general principles of the GDC discharge and the influence of the model input parameters. An important insight gained from this work is that the GDC discharge operates in a so-called hollow-cathode regime: the plasma is sustained mainly by ionization by secondary electrons emitted from the cathode, accelerated ballistically through a thin cathode sheath, penetrating the plasma as a fast electron beam, and trapped by the cathode fall surrounding the plasma on all sides. The electric field distribution inside the plasma, which determines the ion flux distribution on the vessel walls, is controlled by low-energy plasma bulk electrons. The relatively small surface area of the anode leads to the formation of an anode glow affecting the plasma uniformity. Comparisons with experimental data and predictions for ITER are presented in a companion paper.},

  abstract = {The Z-pinch, perhaps the oldest subject in plasma physics, has achieved a remarkable renaissance in recent years, following a few decades of neglect due to its basically unstable MHD character. Using wire arrays, a significant transition at high wire number led to a great improvement in both compression and uniformity of the Z-pinch. Resulting from this the Z-accelerator at Sandia at 20 MA in 100 ns has produced a powerful, short pulse, soft x-ray source {$>$}230 TW for 4.5 ns) at a high efficiency of {$\sim$}15\%. This has applications to inertial confinement fusion. Several hohlraum designs have been tested. The vacuum hohlraum has demonstrated the control of symmetry of irradiation on a capsule, while the dynamic hohlraum at a higher radiation temperature of 230 eV has compressed a capsule from 2 mm to 0.8 mm diameter with a neutron yield {$>$}3 \texttimes{} 1011 thermal DD neutrons, a record for any capsule implosion. World record ion temperatures of {$>$}200 keV have recently been measured in a stainless-steel plasma designed for K{$\alpha$} emission at stagnation, due, it was predicted, to ion-viscous heating associated with the dissipation of fast-growing short wavelength nonlinear MHD instabilities. Direct fusion experiments using deuterium gas-puffs have yielded 3.9\texttimes 1013 neutrons with only 5\% asymmetry, suggesting for the first time a mainly thermal source. The physics of wire-array implosions is a dominant theme. It is concerned with the transformation of wires to liquid-vapour expanding cores; then the generation of a surrounding plasma corona which carries most of the current, with inward flowing low magnetic Reynolds number jets correlated with axial instabilities on each wire; later an almost constant velocity, snowplough-like implosion occurs during which gaps appear in the cores, leading to stagnation on the axis, and the production of the main soft-x-ray pulse. These studies have been pursued also with smaller facilities in other laboratories around the world. At Imperial College, conical and radial wire arrays have led to highly collimated tungsten plasma jets with a Mach number of {$>$}20, allowing laboratory astrophysics experiments to be undertaken. These highlights will be underpinned in this review with the basic physics of Z-pinches including stability, kinetic effects, and finally its applications.},

The time evolution of the distribution functions of the heated species is determined by the balance between the wave-particle interactions and the Coulomb collisions. The ion cyclotron heating can produce highly anisotropic velocity distributions with large energetic tails. The orbits of these high energy ions will experience large deviations from the magnetic flux surfaces. The transfer of toroidal momentum from the wave will give rise to a spatial inward or outward induced transport of the high energy ions depending of the toroidal direction of wave propagation. Further, the wave propagation and damping properties are determinated by the details of the distribution functions. Hence, both the Fokker-Planck equation of the distribution function and the wave equation have to be solved self-consistently.},

  abstract = {We will display the fundamental structure of classical electrodynamics. Starting from the axioms of (1) electric charge conservation, (2) the existence of a Lorentz force density, and (3) magnetic flux conservation, we will derive Maxwell's equations. They are expressed in terms of the field strengths \$(E,\{\textbackslash cal B\})\$, the excitations \$(\{\textbackslash cal D\},H)\$, and the sources \$(\textbackslash rho,j)\$. This fundamental set of four microphysical equations has to be supplemented by somewhat less general constitutive assumptions in order to make it a fully determined system with a well-posed initial value problem. It is only at this stage that a distance concept (metric) is required for space-time. We will discuss one set of possible constitutive assumptions, namely \$\{\textbackslash cal D\}\textbackslash sim E\$ and \$H\textbackslash sim \{\textbackslash cal B\}\$. \{\textbackslash em file erik8a.tex, 1999-07-27\}},

  abstract = {We sketch the foundations of classical electrodynamics, in particular the transition that took place when Einstein, in 1915, succeeded to formulate general relativity. In 1916 Einstein demonstrated that, with a choice of suitable variables for the electromagnetic field, it is possible to put Maxwell's equation into a form that is covariant under general coordinate transformations. This unfolded, by basic contributions of Kottler, Cartan, van Dantzig, Schouten \& Dorgelo, Toupin \& Truesdell, and Post, to what one may call \{\textbackslash em premetric classical electrodynamics.\} This framework will be described shortly. An analysis is given of the physical dimensions involved in electrodynamics and subsequently the question of units addressed. It will be pointed out that these results are untouched by the generalization of classical to quantum electrodynamics (QED). We compare critically our results with those of \{\textbackslash sl L.B. Okun\} which he had presented at a recent conference.},

Model discs of CVD diamond grades (30/40 mm diameter) were irradiated to fluences between 1020 and 1022 n/m2 (E \textbackslash{} 0.1 MeV). For a torus window demonstrator, a large area diamond disc of (106 mm diameter) was irradiated to 0.9. \texttimes{} 1021 n/m2. Mechanical strength tests were performed with specimens (11 mm diameter) cut from medium size diamond discs (62 mm diameter). In contrast to dielectric and mechanical properties, the most sensitive material parameter is thermal conductivity for which at 10-4 dpa a significant reduction by about a factor of 2 has to be accounted for. Comparative dielectric measurements for Quartz discs and special silica glass grades (Infrasil, KU1) showed that loss in quartz stayed at the tan l-level of 10-4 at least up to 1022 n/m2; loss in the unirradiated KU1 glass reached the 10-3 level. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The dielectric window of a 35\textendash 60 MHz ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) transmission line is designed for reactor conditions in due consideration of irradiation, dielectric heating, fabrication issues, and remote handling. Electric field, temperature distribution, and thermal stresses are evaluated for beryllia and alumina dielectrics using finite element codes. The analysis is made for two annular ceramic septa joining coaxial water-cooled conductors having maximum operating 50 kV peak rf voltage and 30 V characteristic impedance. For unfavourable irradiation conditions ( \textbackslash{} 1023 n/m2 neutron fluence), alumina is found to be heated excessively to about 1000 \textdegree C with unacceptable stresses. For moderately irradiated beryllia ( B 1022 n/m2) or for unirradiated alumina of specific grades (tan l comparable or less than 5 \texttimes{} 10-4), the temperature and the thermal stresses are found to stay acceptable provided niobium or titanium is used as a conductor. Beryllia (BeO) is chosen as a candidate for the window ceramic because of its better thermal conductivity and smaller thermal expansion mismatch with the conductor material helping also the manufacturing process. The characteristics for the ceramic/metal joints are estimated for candidate conductor and ceramic (alumina) materials. Vacuum brazing using active filler materials provides sufficiently good conditions for heat conduction across the joint, and the joints appear to be tight enough. Suitable window location on the transmission line is investigated by calculating neutron fluences at the window using an experimental reactor like configuration with 2500 h total burn time (1500 MW). \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The power handling and coupling of a folded waveguide (FWG) antenna array in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) are analysed numerically for reactor plasma conditions. The fields inside the FWG unit are approximated in the model of the usual rectangular waveguide that will result from unfolding the FWG, keeping the corresponding dimensions. Including the surface impedance for a hot reactor sized plasma and the external current simulating the short probe source inside the waveguide allows one to investigate the coupling between units, the input impedance and the matching of a system consisting of several FWG units. Reconstructing the field structure both inside the waveguides and in the vacuum layer (between the coupler front and the plasma), the poloidal and toroidal spectra of the waves launched into the plasma are computed in the case where the effect of the poloidal magnetic field is neglected. Assuming 60 MHz frequency and specific ITER relevant waveguide and plasma parameters with 5 cm scrape-off decay length and 10 cm vacuum gap between the plasma and the waveguide, the present model with idealized non-perturbed feeder excitation predicts a voltage of less than 40 kV along the current probe source, a maximum electric field below 30 kV'cm-l and a maximum voltage of the order of 250 kV inside the FWG with ten folds for 10 MW radiated power per unit. For a waveguide complex composed of eight units, the mutual coupling between the units is found to be non-negligible, indicating a need for tuning in the system circuit.},

In a standard pillbox geometiry with a pressure of less than 10.' torr, surface discharges on an alumina window and multipactor-like discharges starting at the waveguide edges occur simultaneously. To clarify physical mechanisms, window breakdown with purely tangential electrical microwave fields is investigated for special geometries. Other configurations, such as air filled two window setups, relevant for vacuum-air interfaces, can be investi,gated as well. Diagnostics include the measurement of incidentheflected power, measurement of local microwave fields, discharge luminosity, and x-ray emission. All quantities are recorded with 0 . 2 to 1 ns resolution. In addition, a framing camera with gating times of 5 ns is used. Based on the experimental results, methods to increase the power density which can be transmitted through windows, such as surface coatings and window profiles, will be investigated as well.},

This paper reviews the rationale for embedding differential forms in the more comprehensive system of Geometric Calculus. The most significant application of the system is to relativistic physics where it is referred to as Spacetime Calculus. The fundamental integral theorems are discussed along with applications to physics, especially electrodynamics.},

  abstract = {Firstly, a brief overview will be given on different models that are able to describe the behaviour of wave propagation as a function of specific frequency ranges. Each range corresponds to different heating systems, namely, 20\textendash 100~MHz for the ion cyclotron resonant heating, 2\textendash 20~GHz for lower-hybrid heating or current drive, and 100\textendash 250~GHz for electron cyclotron resonant heating or current drive systems. The specification of every system will be explained in detail, including the typical set of equations and the assumptions needed to describe the properties of these heating or current drive systems, as well as their specific domains of validity. In these descriptions, special attention will be paid to the boundary conditions. A review of specific physical problems associated with the wave heating systems will also be provided. The review will detail the role of simulation in answering questions that arise from experiments on magnetized plasma devices devoted to fusion. A few examples that will be covered are the impact of edge turbulence on wave propagation and its consequences on heating system performance, the effects of fast particles and ponderomotive effects, among others. A study that is more focused on radio-frequency sheath effects will also be discussed. It shows that such simulations require very sophisticated tools to gain a partial understanding of the observations undertaken in dedicated experiments. To conclude this review, an overview will be given about the requirements and progress necessary to obtain relevant predictive simulation tools able to describe the wave heating systems used in fusion devices.},

From the point-of-view of design and manufacturing this coupler geometry is attractive since it does not require capacitive loading. This comes at the expense of bandwidth: measured results show that over a 6.5\% bandwidth 0.125-dB power equality, 30 dB isolation and 1.07 VSWR is achieved for a coupler of length 1.25 . Although this is less than the 15\% achieved for capacitively-loaded couplers it is sufficient for many applications and the simplicity of the geometry makes it an attractive option in narrowband designs.

  abstract = {The Advanced LOwer Hybrid Antenna (ALOHA) code, has been developed to improve the modelling of the coupling of lower hybrid (LH) waves from the antenna to a cold inhomogeneous plasma while keeping a fast tool. In contrast to the previous code Slow Wave ANtenna (SWAN) (that only described the interaction of the slow wave between the waveguides and the plasma in a 1D model), the equations are now solved in 2D including the contribution of both the slow and fast waves, with a low computational cost. This approach is completed either by a full-wave computation of the antenna that takes into account its detailed geometry or by a mode-matching code dedicated to multijunctions modelling, which is convenient in preliminary design phases. Moreover, ALOHA can treat more realistic scrape-off layers in front of the antenna, by using a two-layer electron density profile. The ALOHA code has been compared with experimental results from Tore Supra LH antennas of different geometries, as well as benchmarked against other LH coupling codes, with very good results. Once validated, ALOHA has been used as a support for the design of COMPASS and ITER LH antennas and has shown to be a fast and reliable tool for LH antenna design.},

Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) is currently the most efficient method to generate a continuous additional off-axis toroidal plasma current as well as reduce the poloidal flux consumption during the plasma current ramp-up phase. The operation of the Tore Supra ITER-like LH launcher and 700kW CW klystrons have demonstrated the ability to couple LH power at ITER-like power densities with very low reflected power during long pulses. However, in order to achieve pure stationary LH sustained plasmas, some R\&D are needed to increase the reliability of all the systems and codes, from the RF sources to the plasma scenario prediction. The CEA/IRFM is addressing some of these issues by leading a R\&D program toward an ITER LH system and by the validation of an integrated LH modeling suite of codes. In 2011, the RF design of a mode converter has been validated at low power. A 500 kW/5 s RF window is currently under manufacturing and will be tested at high power in 2012 in collaboration with NFRI. All of this work aims to reduce the operational risks associated with the ITER steady-state operations.},

The window design rely on a symmetrical pill-box concept with a cylindrical beryllium oxide ceramic brazed on an actively water cooled copper skirt. The ceramic RF properties have been measured on a test sample to get realistic values for guiding the design. Low power measurements of the manufactured windows show return losses below -32 dB and insertion losses between -0.01 dB and -0.05 dB, with an optimum frequency shifted toward lower frequencies. High power tests conducted at NFRI show unexpected total power loss for both windows. The ceramic temperature during RF pulses has been found to reach unexpected high temperature, preventing these windows to be used under CW conditions. A post-mortem RF analysis of samples taken from one window shows that the dielectric properties of the ceramic were not the ones measured on the manufacturer sample, which partly explain the differences with the reference modelling.},

  abstract = {Embedded RF contacts are integrated within the ITER ICRH launcher to allow assembling, sliding and to lower the thermo-mechanical stress. They have to withstand a peak RF current up to 2.5 kA at 55 MHz in steady-state conditions, in the vacuum environment of the machine. The contacts have to sustain a temperature up to 250 {$\smwhtcircle$}C during several days in baking operations and have to be reliable during the whole life of the launcher without degradation. The RF contacts are critical components for the launcher performance and intensive R\&D is therefore required, since no RF contacts have so far been qualified at these specifications. In order to test and validate the anticipated RF contacts in operational conditions, CEA has prepared a test platform consisting of a steady-state vacuum pumped RF resonator. In collaboration with ITER Organization and the CYCLE consortium (CYclotron CLuster for Europe), an R\&D program has been conducted to develop RF contacts that meet the ITER ICRH launcher specifications. A design proposed by CYCLE consortium, using brazed lamellas supported by a spring to improve thermal exchange efficiency while guaranteeing high contact force, was tested successfully in the Tresonator up to 1.7 kA during 1200 s, but failed for larger current values due to a degradation of the contacts. Details concerning the manufacturing of the brazed contacts on its titanium holder, the RF tests results performed on the resonator and the non-destructive tests analysis of the contacts are given in this paper.},

The design and construction of three new WEST ICRH antennas are being carried out in close collaboration with ASIPP, within the framework of the Associated Laboratory in the fusion field between IRFM and ASIPP. The coupling performance to the plasma and the load-tolerance have been improved, while adding Continuous Wave operation capability by introducing water cooling in the entire antenna. On the generator side, the operation class of the high power tetrodes is changed from AB to B in order to allow high power operation (up to 3 MW per antenna) under higher VSWR (up to 2:1). Reliability of the generators is also improved by increasing the cavity breakdown voltage. The control and data acquisition system is also upgraded in order to resolve and react on fast events, such as ELMs. A new optical arc detection system comes in reinforcement of the Vr/Vf and SHAD systems.},

  abstract = {Magnetic confinement fusion researches are an approach to demonstrate the feasibility of nuclear fusion power for energy production. In these experiments, mega-watt range power Radio-Frequency waves, from tens of MHz to hundreds of GHz, are injected into magnetically confined plasmas in order to increase its temperature and to extend its duration. These RF systems are subjected to the magnetic field environment of the experiments, ranging from few tenth of Tesla to Tesla, and various orientations depending of their locations. As these RF systems made of copper, silver or ceramics are located in vacuum environments, they are subject to multipactor discharges. These discharges are generally considered detrimental since they can lead to detuned RF systems, limit the RF power transmission in the plasma and eventually damage RF sources or components. In some case, especially in the MHz range of frequency, multipactor discharges can be desired for vacuum conditioning. This paper presents the various RF systems used in magnetic fusion experiments and review the work performed in the fusion research community on multipactor discharges for high power coaxial (MHz) and rectangular waveguides (GHz) transmission lines, with their practical implications on power delivery into the plasma.},

Radio-Frequency (RF) contacts are integrated within the ITER ICRH launcher in order to ensure the RF current continuity and ease the mechanical assembly by allowing the free thermal expansion of the Removable Vacuum Transmission Line coaxial conductors during RF operations or during 250 \textdegree C baking phases. A material study has been carried out to determine which materials and associated coatings are relevant for RF contacts application in ITER. In parallel, RF tests have been performed with a new prototype of Multi-Contact\textregistered{} LA-CUT/0,25/0 contacts made of silver-coated CuCrZr louvers. During these tests on a RF vacuum resonator, currents between 1.2 kA and 1.3 kA peak have been reached a few tens of times in steady-state conditions without any visible damage on the louvers. A final 62 MHz pulse ending in a 300 s flat top at 1.9 kA resulted in severe damage to the contact. In addition, a test bed which performs sliding test cycles has been built in order to reproduce the wear of the contact prototype after 30 000 sliding cycles on a 3 mm stroke at 175 \textdegree C under vacuum. The silver coating of the louvers is removed after approximately a hundred cycles whilst, to the contrary, damage to the CuCrZr louvers is relatively low.},

  abstract = {The coupling between cold magnetized plasmas with lower hybrid resonance frequency antennas is generally addressed using specifically developed codes. These antenna coupling codes often approximate the plasma to a surface impedance described by a 1D half infinite models and antennas either with simplified 2D dimensions or from 3D CAD models conversion. Such approaches add an additional step of model approximation/conversion which is not convenient to rapidly assess impact of geometry changes on coupling performances. In this work, we assess the ability of using ANSYS HFSS to describe the usual range of experimental magnetized cold plasma inhomogeneous parameters facing LHRF antennas, away from resonances, in order to guide the RF designer during the design phase of an antenna. The coupling calculations of Lower Hybrid Resonance Frequency antennas are performed and successfully benchmarked with the fast coupling codes ALOHA on inhomogeneous cold magnetized plasmas. Good agreements are obtained when the boundary conditions in the full-wave modelling are properly handled. Practical advices and limitations are given in order to define correctly these boundary conditions and insure correct results.},

The antenna is modelled by connecting the various elements that compose it, separately full-wave modelled. Tunable elements, such as the matching capacitors, can be either created from ideal lump components or from interpolating full-wave calculations performed at various capacitance configurations.

  abstract = {From both simulation and theoretical perspectives, the current density profile of magnetized plasma is expected to play an important role in turbulence. Optimization of both the safety factor q and the magnetic shear s can reduce turbulence, and therefore heat transport. Experimentally, external sources of heating and/or noninductive current drive have been used in Tore Supra to modify the current profile. In these experiments, electron heat diffusivity and turbulence level were found to be reduced when increasing s or reversing the q profile (i.e., negative s). As a consequence, confinement was improved. Core electron heat transport has been investigated. A critical threshold temperature gradient, above which turbulence strongly increases, has been experimentally determined. A parametric dependence study of this threshold pointed out the role of the ratio s/q, as expected by turbulence theory and simulations, thus explaining improved confinement regimes. Finally, thanks to the unique Tore Supra experimental conditions, the role of the q profile on turbulent particle transport was investigated. We have demonstrated that the electron density profile peaking is strongly governed by the q profile in low collisionality plasmas with dominant trapped electron modes.},

This required both advanced technology integration and steady-state real-time plasma control. In particular, an improvement of the plasma position to within a range of few millimetres, and new real-time controls of radio frequency power and various actuators built around a shared memory network, have allowed Tore Supra to access a powerful steady-state regime with an improved safety level for the actively cooled plasma facing components. Feedback controlled fully non-inductive plasma discharges have been sustained in a steady-state regime for up to 6 min with a new world record for injected\textendash extracted energy exceeding 1 GJ.

No bulk and surface RIED are found up to 1X5 \^A 10\`A5 dpa. If the alpha-particles produced by high neutrons are assumed to be negligible, then AlN can be used as an alternative candidate material for the coating on the blanket of fusion reactors, because of the absence of severe thermally stimulated conductivity (TSC) and bulk and surface degradation under fusion reactors environments. \'O 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This parallel magnetic field imposes electron Larmor motion, which restricts the trajectories of electrons accelerated by the RF field. In open geometries, magnetic confinement reduces electron losses in the multipactor region and can reduce the breakdown threshold. In this paper, the effect of magnetic confinement on multipactor breakdown threshold was measured experimentally using a stripline fixture with an externally applied uniform magnetic field. Multipactor threshold power was reduced from the unmagnetized case by as much as 3 dB at magnetic fields of about 0.5 kG. Multipactor gap aspect ratio has a significant impact on the degree of threshold reduction.},

  abstract = {The application of lower hybrid range of frequencies (LHRF) waves in H-mode plasmas on Alcator C-Mod can result in a significant reduction in core particle inventory, with no significant degradation of energy confinement. This phenomenon has been observed in steady enhanced D{$\alpha$} (EDA) H-mode targets, which are sustained by ion cyclotron RF auxiliary heating, in which pedestal density nped is usually tied firmly to plasma current IP and shows a strong resilience to changes in the edge neutral source. Upon application of up to 1 MW LHRF power, nped is reduced by up to 30\%, while the temperature profile increases simultaneously such that the pressure pedestal remains constant or is slightly increased. Steady EDA H-mode operation with no edge-localized modes can be maintained while edge collisionality is reduced by factors of reduction of 2\textendash 4. Elevation of scrape-off layer (SOL) density and electric currents accompany the application of LHRF (at levels as low as 400 kW) with a fast time response ({$\sim$}10-2 s), while full density pedestal relaxation and core density reduction occur on longer time scales ({$\sim$}10-1 s). A similarly prompt counter-IP change in the edge toroidal velocity is also observed in response to LHRF, followed on longer time scales by a counter-IP change in the central rotation. The range of time scales of the plasma response may indicate that the radial locations of LHRF interactions (i.e. SOL versus core), and power deposition mechanisms, are evolving in time. Understanding the responsible physical mechanisms and applying them to a broad range of discharges could provide a tool for improved H-mode density control.},

Expressions are derived for the reflected, transmitted, and radiated power, which are shown to be sufficiently reliable in the domain of practical interest, regarding the width and the dielectric loading of the gap. The analysis shows that a substantial fraction of the microwave power leaks from the dielectric gap, confirming the absolute necessity of using a choke-flange at the waveguide junction.},

The RF power in the module is divided into 12 at a junction point in the toroidal direction. This design makes the launcher structure very simple. The RF properties of a prototype module are studied by using dummy loads. It is shown that the phasing and power dividing rate are well explained by the scattering matrix method, when the reflection coefficient of sub-waveguides is less than -10\%. This launcher is expected to improve current drive efficiency 20-30\% compared with the previous JT-60 LHCD multijunction launcher. This launcher will be operated at the beginning of 1993.},

Moreover, the breakdown of gas in the waveguide is enhanced by the discharge. The discharge can be suppressed by sufficient RF conditioning and/or by coating the window with materials having a low secondary electron-emission ratio such as carbon or TiN.

  abstract = {Waves at a frequency close to the lower hybrid (LH) resonance are widely used in tokamaks for non-inductive current drive. Modelling of LH waves is usually carried out by combining a Ray-tracing (RT) code for computing the LH waves propagation to a solver of the Fokker\textendash Planck (FP) equation which calculates an electron distribution function self-consistently with the waves absorption. The DELPHINE code has been developed along this approach with accurate treatment of the magnetic equilibrium and the fast electrons dynamics in momentum space. Using this code, the influence of the plasma current on the LH waves propagation and absorption is investigated in detail. High plasma current is found to broaden the absorbed LH spectrum towards high phase velocities, thus increasing the current drive efficiency of the waves. The shape of the current density profile also has an impact on the propagation of the waves and the resulting power deposition. In discharges where the current profile is dominated by LH current drive (LHCD), this dependence leads to the auto-regulation of the LHCD via the current density profile. The RT/FP technique reproduces at least qualitatively some of the experimental trends, though inconsistencies still remain. Perspectives for improving the relevance of the modelling are discussed.},

We have attempted to produce a self consistent picture of triggering, arc evolution and surface damage. We are modeling these mechanisms using Molecular Dynamics (mechanical failure, Coulomb explosions, self sputtering), Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes (plasma evolution), mesoscale surface thermodynamics (surface evolution), and finite element electrostatic modeling (field enhancements).

  abstract = {We describe breakdown in 805 MHz rf accelerator cavities in terms of a number of self consistent mechanisms. We divide the breakdown process into three stages: 1) we model surface failure using molecular dynamics of fracture caused by electrostatic tensile stress, 2) we model the ionization of neutrals responsible for plasma initiation and plasma growth using a particle in cell code, and 3) we model surface damage by assuming a process similar to unipolar arcing. We find that the cold, dense plasma in contact with the surface produces very small Debye lengths and very high electric fields over a large area, consistent with unipolar arc behavior, although unipolar arcs are strictly defined with equipotential boundaries. These high fields produce strong erosion mechanisms, primarily self sputtering, compatible with the crater formation that we see. We use OOPIC modeling to estimate very high surface electric fields in the dense plasma and measure these field using electrohydrodynamic arguments to relate the dimensions of surface damage with the applied electric field. We also present a geometrical explanation of the large enhancement factors of field emitters.This is consistent with the apparent absence of whiskers on surfaces exposed to high fields. The enhancement factors we derive, when combined with the Fowler-Nordheim analysis produce a consistent picture of breakdown and field emission from surfaces at local fields of 7 - 10 GV/m. We show that the plasma growth rates we obtain from OOPIC are consistent with growth rates of the cavity shorting currents using x ray measurements. We believe the general picture presented here for rf breakdown arcs should be directly applicable to a larger class of vacuum arcs. Results from the plasma simulation are included as a guide to experimental verification of this model.},

The antenna coupling efficiency and the shape of the wavenumber spectrum are found as a solution of a self-consistent problem taking into account a complete set of waveguide eigenmodes and finite waveguide dimensions in both directions and an arbitrary orientation to the plasma magnetic field. Electric and magnetic fields inside the waveguides are equated to the outside fields represented as a Fourier sum over wavenumbers N g ,N , in the plane parallel to the plasma surface. The fields at the plasma edge are determined by the 2 x 2 plasma surface impedance matrix found as a numerical solution of the wave equation in the cold plasma approximation using the finite element (Galerkin) method. The solution is found on a 1-D mesh, i = 1,2,...,N , in the form E(\%\%N,u ,N,) exp[i(N,y + N,t -ut)]so that the fourth order differential equation with appropriate boundary conditions is reduced to a set of 4Nf2 algebraic equations. The developed model is applied to modelling a quite new antenna design for generating the fast H waves, which can be used for plasma heating and current drive in tokamaks of ITER scale. The antenna parameters are optimized to obtain the best coupling efficiency.

  abstract = {Experiments have been performed under the coordination of the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) on several tokamaks, including ASDEX Upgrade (AUG), JET and DIII-D, to characterize the increased Ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) antenna loading achieved by optimizing the position of gas injection relative to the RF antennas. On DIII-D, AUG and JET (with the ITER-Like Wall) a 50\% increase in the antenna loading was observed when injecting deuterium in ELMy H-mode plasmas using mid-plane inlets close to the powered antennas instead of divertor injection and, with smaller improvement when using gas inlets located at the top of the machine. The gas injection rate required for such improvements ( 0.7 \texttimes{} 1022 el s-1 in AUG, 1.0 \texttimes{} 1022 el s-1 in JET) is compatible with the use of this technique to optimize ICRF heating during the development of plasma scenarios and no degradation of confinement was observed when using the mid-plane or top inlets compared with divertor valves. An increase in the scrape-off layer (SOL) density was measured when switching gas injection from divertor to outer mid-plane or top. On JET and DIII-D, the measured SOL density increase when using main chamber puffing is consistent with the antenna coupling resistance increase provided that the distance between the measurement lines of sight and the injection location is taken into account. Optimized gas injection was also found to be beneficial for reducing tungsten (W) sputtering at the AUG antenna limiters, and also to reduce slightly the W and nickel (Ni) content in JET plasmas. Modeling the specific effects of divertor/top/mid-plane injection on the outer mid-plane density was carried out using both the EDGE2D-EIRENE and EMC3-EIRENE plasma boundary code packages; simulations indeed indicate that outer mid-plane gas injection maximizes the density in the mid-plane close to the injection point with qualitative agreement with the AUG SOL density measurements for EMC3-EIRENE. Field line tracing for ITER in the 15 MA Q DT = 10 reference scenario indicates that the planned gas injection system could be used to tailor the density in front the antennas. Benchmarking of EMC3-EIRENE against AUG and JET data is planned as a first step towards the ITER SOL modelling required to quantify the effect of gas injection on the SOL density in front of the antennas.},

Although many difficulties in technology and physics understanding have been solved, all systems proposed for ITER require specific R\&D and no single system can accomplish all the tasks required for its mission. This is particularly true for long pulse operation which is challenging due to demanding plasma {$\beta$} requirements and off-axis current drive efficiency. Such a regime requires several efficient plasma actuators working at the same time to provide central heating (preferably ions), local instability stabilisation and off-axis current drive. Valuable experience is available from presently operating facilities and will be considerably strengthened by several new super conducting devices becoming on line.},

Although the overall specifications are unchanged, notable changes have been approved. Firstly, it has been emphasized that the H\&CD systems are vital for the ITER programme. Consequently, the full 73 MW should be commissioned and available on a routine basis before the D/T phase. Secondly, significant changes have been approved at system level, most notably: the possibility to operate the heating beams at full power during the hydrogen phase requiring new shine through protection; the possibility to operate IC with 2 antennas with increased robustness (no moving parts); the possible increase to 2 MW of key components of the EC transmission systems in order to provide an easier upgrading of the EC power as may be required by the project; the addition of a building dedicated to the RF power sources and to a testing facility for acceptance of diagnostics and heating port plugs. Thirdly, the need of a plan for developing, in time for the active phase, a CD system such as LH suitable for very long pulse operation of ITER was recognised. The review describes these changes and their rationale.},

  abstract = {A novel method to simulate ion cyclotron wave coupling in the edge of a tokamak plasma with the finite element technique is presented. It is applied in the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics. Its main features include the perfectly matched layer (PML) technique to emulate radiating boundary conditions beyond a critical cutoff layer for the fast wave (FW), full-wave propagation across the inhomogeneous cold peripheral plasma and a detailed description of the wave launcher geometry. The PML technique, while widely used in numerical simulations of wave propagation, has scarcely been used for magnetized plasmas, due to specificities of this gyrotropic material. A versatile PML formulation, valid for full dielectric tensors, is summarized and interpreted as wave propagation in an artificial medium. The behavior of this technique has been checked for plane waves on homogeneous plasmas. Wave reflection has been quantified and compared to analytical predictions. An incompatibility issue for adapting the PML for forward (FW) and backward (slow wave (SW)) propagating waves simultaneously has been evidenced. In a tokamak plasma, this critical issue is overcome by taking advantage of the inhomogeneous density profile to reflect the SW before it reaches the PML. The simulated coupling properties of a Tore Supra ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antenna have been compared to experimental values in a situation of good single-pass absorption. The necessary antenna elements to include in the geometry to recover the coupling properties obtained experimentally are also discussed.},

Two models of antennas are compared: 2-strap antenna vs 3-strap antenna. The 2D DC potential structures are correlated to structures of the parallel electric field map for different phasing and power balance. The overall DC plasma potential on the 3-strap antenna is lower due to better global RF currents compensation. Spatial proximity between regions of high RF electric field and regions where high DC plasma potentials are observed is an important factor for sheath rectification.},

To protect these klystrons at rated power, the existing 250-kW CW circulators, connected to each of the klystrons, are required to be upgraded to 500-kW CW rating. Simulation studies are carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics to ascertain the key parameters which limit its performance to the desired value. In this article, we present the simulation and experimental studies of the high power circulator, highlighting major challenges and its solutions. The effect of ferrite temperature on the RF performance of the circulator is analyzed with the help of multiphysics simulations. Accordingly, the configuration of the circulator is modified. A series of low power tests are carried out to characterize the circulator performance. High power tests, up to a few seconds, have been successfully carried out to ensure that no breakdown is observed at rated power. The results from the simulation studies and experiments have enabled us to conclude that the circulator can handle a forward power of 400-kW CW under matched load conditions.},

Two-dimensional variations of the mode fields are presented and the effects of magnetic field and plasma density on the cutoff frequency, guide wavelength and the dispersion relation of the mode are studied. It is seen that the guide wavelength gets larger for the higher plasma density and stronger magnetic field; however, it decreases when the waveguide width and the microwave frequency are increased for other fixed parameters. The trajectory of the electron is analyzed under the effects of various parameters, when the electron is injected in the waveguide along the direction of mode propagation. Two cases are discussed when xp {$<$} Xc and xp {$>$} Xc. Under such situation, the electron acceleration is also studied and it is observed that the acceleration gradient is increased with the microwave frequency.

  abstract = {An efficient intermodal decomposition technique is developed for an accurate reconstruction of the RF field obeying a paraxial approximation such as the output of a gyrotron. This method requires complete RF beam information i.e. its amplitude, measured using infrared thermography technique, and phase, which is calculated by an accurate phase retrieval method using complete scalar diffraction integral. The complex RF field evaluated at several positions along the direction of propagation is then used in our modal decomposition method which is based on minimizing the error between the original field and the optimized field. The minimization method is implemented such that it evaluates the optimized field by calculating the beam parameters and the complex coefficient of each mode simultaneously. During the beam propagation, after phase retrieval method, it is observed that in several cases the output RF beam cannot be analyzed using simple Gaussian beam equation and therefore, we extended our method to a more general case of astigmatic Gaussian beam of higher order modes rotating along the optic axis of propagation.},

It has been observed that considerable outgassing, power dissipation and high reflection take place while diminishing transmitted power with poor reproducibility without the RF conditioning process which cleanses antenna surface by RF surface heating. Outgassing source during the RF conditioning is identified mainly as water vapor. A new dimensionless figure-of-merit to evaluate degree of the RF conditioning is defined with dissipated power and outgassing rate by analyzing experimentally observed RF conditioning data. Optimum performance of the antenna with low figure-of-merit (5\,\texttimes\,10-9) is achieved after conditioning for 3 days a week ({$\sim$}40 shots) at less than 10\,kW of input power. Coefficients of transmission, reflection, and dissipation reach to about 80\%, 2\%, and 18\%, respectively indicating almost doubled antenna performance. Introduced new figure-of-merit provides a quantitative basis for antenna conditioning in order to improve antenna performance.},

For the idealized case of a wedge-shaped geometry, it is shown that only under certain physical circumstances does the singularity and the concomitant strongly enhanced microwave field determine the breakdown strength. In particular, when diffusion is the dominating loss mechanism for the electron density, breakdown is a volumetric process, and the field singularity does not determine the breakdown threshold. In such situations, excessive accuracy in numerical calculations is not required. Conditions for volumetric and localized breakdown, respectively, are established analytically, and the validity is demonstrated by numerical simulations. Finally, the analysis is extrapolated and compared with experimentally observed breakdown thresholds in commercially available resonators of nonidealized geometry. Good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results is demonstrated.},

  pages = {4},
  abstract = {LAL-Orsay is developing an important effort on R\&D and technology studies on RF power couplers for supraconductive cavities. One of the most critical components of those devices is the ceramic RF window that allows the power flux to be injected in the coaxial line. The presence of a dielectric window on a high power RF line has a strong influence on the multipactor phenomena. The most important method to reduce the multipactor is to decrease the secondary emission yield of the ceramic window. Due to its low secondary electron emission coefficient, TiN thin film is used as a multipactor suppressor coating on RF ceramic coupler windows. In this frame work, a TiN sputtering bench has been developed in LAL. The reactive sputtering of TiN needs the optimisation of the gas flow parameters, as well as the electrical one, to obtain stoichiometric deposit. XRD analysis was performed to control the film composition. The obtained measurements point out how the Nitrogen vacancy on the film can be controlled very well acting on the N2 flow during the reacting sputtering process. As the coating thickness should be optimized so that the TiN effectively reduces the SEE coefficient but does not cause excessive heating due to ohmic loss, and before multipactor level breakdown and resistance measurements for different deposit thicknesses, a good control of film thickness is essential. In-situ deposit thickness measurements given by quartz crystal microbalance was compared to X-Ray reflectivity one.

  abstract = {A particular interest is accorded, in LAL-Orsay, to the R\&D and technology studies on RF power couplers for superconductive cavities. One of the most critical components of those devices is the ceramic RF window that allows the power flux to be injected in the coaxial line. The presence of dielectric window on a high power RF line has a strong influence on the multipactor phenomena. The most important method to reduce the multipactor is to decrease the secondary emission yield of the ceramic window. Due to its low Secondary electron Emission Yield (SEY), TiN thin film is used as a multipactor suppressor coating on RF ceramic coupler windows. In this frame work, TiN deposition was made by magnetron reactive sputtering. XPS and XRD analysis were performed to control the compositions and the stoechiometries of the obtained films. Coating thickness was optimized so that the TiN coating effectively reduces the SEY but does not cause excessive heating, due to ohmic loss. For this purpose, SEY measurements on covered and uncovered TiN Alumina substrates and multipactor level breakdown on TiN coated Copper substrates were performed for different deposit thicknesses.},

The expansion utilizes an edge-fixed lattice of expansion beams, involving a phase-space beam expansion along the edge and an angular spectrum of beam around the edge. The excitation amplitudes of the diffracted beams, defined as the beam to beam (B2B) scattering matrix, are derived, interpreted, and validated via a comparison with an exact numerical solution. The representation is valid uniformly as a function of the incident beam direction and its distance from the edge. The asymptotic limits when the beam impinges far from the edge are interpreted via the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). The general procedure for calculating the B2B scattering coefficients may be applied for other wedge-type configurations. The new formulation enables the construction of self-consistent Gaussian beams summation (GBS) representations in complex configurations, in which the field is described as a sum of beam propagators, and the diffracted fields due to the propagators that hit near edges are also expanded in terms of beams. Applications to GBS modeling of urban propagation are discussed.},

Bootstrap current, due to the pressure gradient, and current driven by auxiliary heating systems are currently considered as the two main options. This paper addresses the current drive (CD) potential of the ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating system in DEMO-like plasmas. Fast wave CD scenarios are evaluated for both the standard midplane launch and an alternative case of exciting the waves from the top of the machine. Optimal ICRF frequencies and parallel wave numbers are identified to maximize the CD efficiency. Limitations of the high frequency ICRF CD operation are discussed. A simplified analytical method to estimate the fast wave CD efficiency is presented, complemented with the discussion of its dependencies on plasma parameters. The calculated CD efficiency for the ICRF system is shown to be similar to those for the negative neutral beam injection and electron cyclotron resonance heating.},

We have fabricated and RF tested the 9 in. coaxial hybrid coupler. We obtained an excellent coupling flatness of -3.2 {$\pm$} 0.2 dB, phase difference of 4 degrees and return loss of 16 dB in 40\textendash 55 MHz. The measured data of 9 in. hybrid splitter is highly consistent with HFSS simulations. We found that the proposed 3 dB hybrid splitter can be tunable with amplitude-balanced, broadband response by changing dielectric insulators to keep the inner and outer conductors of coaxial line apart. The proposed 3 dB hybrid splitter can be utilized for load-resilient operations in a wide range of antenna load variations due to mode transitions or edge localized modes (ELMs) in fusion plasmas.},

Circular TE01 mode will be adopted for transmission lines longer than 50 m because it has extremely low loss in oversized waveguide, but mode converters from rectangular TE10 to circular TE01 mode are not easy to design. Mock-ups of two types of mode converters were developed. One is serpentine type, and the other is symmetric sidewall coupling type. The TE01 mode purities were demonstrated by measuring the transmission efficiencies between two identical mode converters at various angles between symmetric planes. A sidewall coupling mode converter with a refined design, which showed better circular symmetry and higher transmission efficiency than serpentine type, is under fabrication for prototype. The prototype mode converter is calculated to have 99.5\% transmission efficiency, with 0.16\% diffraction loss and 0.35\% resistive loss, according to the simulation.},

  abstract = {A prototype of a midplane passive active multijunction (PAM) antenna was fabricated for the lower hybrid current drive system of KSTAR. The antenna includes a PAM launcher, bidirectional couplers, power dividing components, and two RF windows. The RF characteristics of each component, such as the splitting ratio, phase shift, transmission, and reflection, were measured using a network analyzer. A taper adapter and matched load, which can be inserted into the active waveguide of the PAM mouth, were designed and fabricated for the phase shift and power coupling measurement. The maximum error and the standard deviation of measured phase shifts between adjacent active waveguides of the PAM were 6.5\textdegree{} and 2.28\textdegree, respectively. The design improvement of the mid-plane PAM launcher is suggested. Multiple round trips of the reflected field in a multijunction provides the advantage of lowering the reflection but, at the same time, it causes the deterioration of directivity and an increase of the electric field in the waveguide. Adding a hybrid splitter at the end of the multijunction structure reduces the reflection by redirecting the reflection to plasma as in multijunction, however, contrary to the multijunction, it does not switch the toroidal direction of phase progression and thus improves the antenna directivity. The directivity of the hybrid PAM increases by more than 10\% and the reflection decreases to 1/3\textendash 1/ 100 in comparison with the prototype PAM.},

  abstract = {In this study, a klystron for the KSTAR lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) system was developed as a prototype for a 5 GHz, 500 kW CW operation that is aimed to meet the requirement of the ITER LHCD system as well. Before the 2012 KSTAR campaign, the prototype klystron was validated only for 350 kW CW operation. The weakest part of the klystron for 500 kW CW operation was the RF output window failure due to a thermal stress caused by the temperature gradient. The klystron was equipped with two RF windows, each of which should transmit 250 kW power. Prior to the full performance test of the klystron, the performance of the test RF windows that were identical to those mounted on the klystron was tested with half of the klystron's full power. The temperature increase in the test RF windows was monitored using an IR camera. The temperature difference, {$\Delta$}Tce, between the center and edge of the test window at 250-kW 1000-s transmitting power was predicted to be 23 \textdegree C, which is smaller than the safe {$\Delta$}Tce, which is 50 \textdegree C according to the manufacturer. Based on the result of the test window measurement, 500-kW 1000-s operation of the klystron was conducted successfully. The klystron output power characteristics depending on the phase of load reflection VSWR 1.4:1 were investigated. The klystron generated stable power on a load VSWR of 1.4:1 at various phases. The output power at the worst phase was 380 kW. Details of the IR-imaging setup are discussed and the results obtained are presented.},

Impurity release during LH operation was investigated and it was found that there is no significant Be increase with LH power. Concentration of W was analysed in more detail and it was concluded that LH contributes negligibly to its increase. No cases of W accumulation in LH-only heating experiments were observed so far. LH wave coupling was studied and optimised to achieve the level of system performance similar to before ILW installation. Measurements by Li-beam were used to study systematic dependencies of the SOL density on the gas injection rate from a dedicated gas introduction module and the LH power and launcher position. Experimental results are supported by SOL transport modelling. Observations of arcs in front of the LH launcher and hotspots on magnetically connected sections of the vessel are reported. Overall, a relatively troublefree operation of the LH system up to 2.5MW of coupled Radio Frequency (RF) power in L-mode plasma was achieved with no indication that the power cannot be increased further.},

  abstract = {Recent studies at JET focus on analysis of the lower hybrid (LH) wave power absorption and current drive (CD) calculations by means of a new ray tracing (RT)/Fokker\textendash Planck (FP) package. The RT code works in real 2D geometry accounting for the plasma boundary and the launcher shape. LH waves with different parallel refractive index, N{$\parallel$}, spectra in poloidal direction can be launched thus simulating authentic antenna spectrum with rows fed by different combinations of klystrons. Various FP solvers were tested most advanced of which is a relativistic bounce averaged FP code. LH wave power deposition profiles from the new RT/FP code were compared to the experimental results from electron cyclotron emission (ECE) analysis of pulses at 3.4 T low and high density. This kind of direct comparison between power deposition profiles from experimental ECE data and numerical model were carried out for the first time for waves in the LH range of frequencies. The results were in a reasonable agreement with experimental data at lower density, line averaged values of n\textrightarrow e {$\approx$} 2.4 \texttimes{} 1019 m-3. At higher density, n\textrightarrow e {$\approx$} 3 \texttimes{} 1019 m-3, the code predicted larger on-axis LH power deposition, which is inconsistent with the experimental observations. Both calculations were unable to produce LH wave absorption at the plasma periphery, which contradicts to the analysis of the ECE data and possible sources of these discrepancies have been briefly discussed in the paper. The code was also used to calculate the LH power deposition and CD profiles for the low-density preheat phase of JET's advanced tokamak (AT) scenario. It was found that as the density evolves from hollow to flat and then to a more peaked profile the LH power and driven current move inward i.e. towards the plasma axis. A total driven current of about 70 kA for 1 MW of launched LH power was predicted in these conditions.},

  abstract = {Multipactor is a pernicious electrical discharge that can damage or destroy microwave components and related electronics, such as antennas, satellite payloads, or radar systems. Driven by the emission of secondary electrons from the surface of the structure, multipactor can result in rapid growth in the number of electrons. Past theoretical studies of multipactor have relied on two approaches: (a) Analytical treatment of the simplest cases, e.g., a resonant mode in a parallel plate structure; (b) Numerical simulation involving integration of trajectories of many particles (tracking), or Monte Carlo models. Simulations have demonstrated considerable success in predicting multipactor for specific devices, but the results are difficult to generalize and the scalings are not obvious. Detailed analytical treatment of higher-periodicity modes becomes overwhelmingly complex, especially with the addition of surface charging or magnetic fields. This paper presents a novel approach, based on systematic application of iterative maps, capable of analyzing a wide range of multipactor problems. The new methodology borrows the standard tools of nonlinear dynamics and chaos to identify multipacting region boundaries and stability more reliably and comprehensively than existing models. It does so by globally analyzing the structure of dynamical space rather than individually analyzing every possible multipacting mode.},

The approach taken is to approximate the discontinuity as a string of closely spaced planar discontinuities. At each planar discontinuity, the transmission and reflection properties of the junction are computed by the mode-matching technique - a method which represents the fields on either side of the junction as a sum of known basis functions, and determines the weighting coefficients by matching the fields across an aperture. The junctions are then cascaded to determine the overall scattering characteristics. Computer code is presented that implements the algorithms, and results are closely correlated to measurements and other analysis methods.},

As far as the recent developments in theory are concerned, it is found that full wave models appear to be consistent with ray-tracing models and to yield comparable results when applied to selected cases where both are applicable. Methods for including consistent gradient terms in the wave equation have now been found; however, a unified understanding of the impact of such corrections is desirable. From the experimental point of view several procedures have been developed based on sawteeth analysis, modulation or simulation, to evaluate the fraction of the power coupled to the plasma bulk and the power deposition profiles. Comparison between experiments and theory on these subjects as well as for coupling indicates that the ICRF physics is well understood. Tail analysis has been done extensively only for PLT; further work is going on for JET and TEXTOR, which clearly reveals their presence and the importance of their role. chi e analysis in the presence of RF has also been done; however, several of the presently available thermal diffusion models seem to be able to fit the experimental data. It is concluded that, in the ICRF field, theory nowadays provides quite reliable tools and that extensive comparisons with experiments should be pursued in order to provide the basis for the understanding of the interplay between heating, velocity diffusion, confinement and edge effects.},

The FFT is required to withstand over 200 kW of power (20 kW/cm2) at high VSWR ({$>$}5) for 1\textendash 3 s pulses spaced 10-min apart. Breakdown measurements and fabrication considerations will be discussed. In addition, simulation of thermal conditions will be shown. The FFT will be computer controlled and must react to matching a load in a few hundred microseconds. This puts a severe requirement on power supply response time and its variation. In addition, the calculation time of the controlling software algorithms must be considered as well as the diffusion time of the controlling magnetic field through the waveguide wall. We will discuss these requirements and what we have done to meet them.},

The results give performance that closely agrees with the performance specifications issued by AFT.

  abstract = {A finite element code that solves self-consistent radio-frequency (RF) sheathplasma interaction problems is improved by incorporating a generalized sheath boundary condition in the macroscopic solution scheme. This sheath boundary condition makes use of a complex sheath impedance including both the sheath capacitance and resistance, which enables evaluation of not only the RF voltage across the sheath but also the power dissipation in the sheath. The newly developed finite element procedure is applied to cases where the background magnetic field is perpendicular to the sheath surface in one- and two-dimensional domains filled by uniform low- and high-density plasmas. The numerical results are compared with those obtained by employing the previous capacitive sheath model at a typical frequency for ion cyclotron heating used in fusion experiments. It is shown that for sheaths on the order of 100 V in a high-density plasma, localized RF power deposition can reach a level which causes material damage. It is also shown that the sheathplasma wave resonances predicted by the capacitive sheath model do not occur when parameters are such that the generalized sheath impedance model substantially modifies the capacitive character of the sheath. Possible explanations for the difference in the maximum RF sheath voltage depending on the plasma density are also discussed.},

The multipactor discharge was observed in an evacuated standard rectangular waveguide through which pulsed high-power microwave radiation in the decimeter wavelength range was transmitted. The power interval in which the two-sided (between the wide walls of the waveguide) multipactor appeared has been determined. It is found that there is a characteristic delay time for the onset of the multipactor breakdown as compared with the time at which the microwave power is applied. The dependence of this delay time on the microwave power has been established. The experimental results are compared with results of numerical simulations which make it possible to estimate the secondary emission properties of the waveguide walls. Reasons for some observed discrepancies between numerical results and experimental data are discussed as well as the nature of the observed multipactor delay.},

It is shown that for a fourwaveguide array with alternate 0, n phases, optimum coupling is obtained when the inside waveguides carry about four times the power of the outside ones.

  abstract = {The dense plasma focus (DPF) is a Z-pinch that has been studied for 50 years. Within ten years of its discovery by Fillipov and Fillipova in Russia and Mather in the USA, this dense pinch was scaled up to 2-MA currents and neutron outputs of {$\sim$}1012/pulse. More remarkable is the fact that most of the relevant physics and scaling laws were elucidated within this first decade. The subsequent period has seen this type of pinch used as a teaching tool, developed as a portable neutron source for security applications, as a soft X-ray source for lithography, and as an energetic ion source for nanofabrication applications. This review builds upon several prior reviews. From the plasma physics standpoint, DPF physics is examined in light of fast Z-pinches to examine the similarities. More cross-fertilization between the two communities is suggested as a means to improve both types of pinches. From the applications standpoint, the many uses of DPFs are summarized to demonstrate the versatility of these pinches. Their ease of assembly and relatively low voltage operation have allowed DPFs to be disseminated worldwide as fusion testbeds (unlike their fast Z-pinch counterparts). Smaller or less economically developed nations have made valuable contributions to our understanding of the physics, as evidenced by the rich lode of publications that have advanced the field.},

  abstract = {Waves in the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) enhance local Plasma-Surface Interactions (PSI) near the wave launchers and magnetically-connected objects via Radio-Frequency (RF) sheath rectification. ITER will use 20MW of ICRF power over long pulses, questioning the long-term impact of RF-enhanced localized erosion on the lifetime of its Beryllium (Be) wall. Recent dedicated ICRF-heated L-mode discharges documented this process on JET for different types of ICRF antennas. Using visible spectroscopy in JET ICRF-heated L-mode discharges, poloidally-localized regions of enhanced (by {$\sim$}2\textendash 4x) Be I and Be II light emission were observed on two outboard limiters magnetically connected to the bottom of the active ITER-Like Antenna (ILA). The observed RF-PSI induced by the ILA was qualitatively comparable to that induced by the JET standard, type-A2 antennas, for similar strap toroidal phasing and connection geometries. The Be II line emission was found more intense when powering the bottom half of the ILA rather than its top half. Conversely, more pronounced SOL density modifications were observed with only top array operation, on field lines connected to the top half of the ILA. So far the near-field modeling of the ILA with antenna code TOPICA (Torino Polytechnic Ion Cyclotron Antenna), using curved antenna model, was partially able to reproduce qualitatively the observed phenomena. A quantitative discrepancy persisted between the observed Be source amplification and the calculated, corresponding increases in E// field at the magnetically connected locations to the ILA when changing from only top to only bottom half antenna operation. This paper revisits these current drive phased and half-ILA powered cases using for the new simulations flat model of the ILA and more realistic antenna feeding to calculate the E// field maps with TOPICA code. Further, the Self-consistent Sheaths and Waves for Ion Cyclotron Heating Slow Wave (SSWICH-SW) code, which couples slow wave evanescence with DC Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) biasing, is used to estimate the poloidal distribution of rectified RF-sheath Direct Current (DC) potential VDC in the private SOL between the ILA poloidal limiters. The approach so far was limited to correlating the observed, enhanced emission regions at the remote limiters to the antenna near-electric fields, as calculated by TOPICA. The present approach includes also a model for the rectification of these near-fields in the private SOL of the ILA. With the improved approach, when comparing only top and only bottom half antenna feeding, we obtained good qualitative correlation between all experimental measurements and the calculated local variations in the E// field and VDC potential.},

Sorbom et al., FED 100 (2015) 378] to explore options for managing {$\sim$}525 MW of fusion power generated in a compact, high field (B0 = 9.2 T) tokamak that is approximately the size of JET (R0 = 3.3 m). Taking advantage of ARC's novel design \textendash{} demountable high temperature superconductor toroidal field (TF) magnets, poloidal magnetic field coils located inside the TF, and vacuum vessel (VV) immersed in molten salt FLiBe blanket \textendash{} this follow-on study has identified innovative and potentially robust power exhaust management solutions. The superconducting poloidal field coil set has been reconfigured to produce double-null plasma equilibria with a long-leg X-point target divertor geometry. This design choice is motivated by recent modeling which indicates that such configurations enhance power handling and may attain a passively-stable detachment front that stays in the divertor leg over a wide power exhaust window. A modified VV accommodates the divertor legs while retaining the original core plasma volume and TF magnet size. The molten salt FLiBe blanket adequately shields all superconductors, functions as an efficient tritium breeder, and, with augmented forced flow loops, serves as an effective singlephase, low-pressure coolant for the divertor, VV, and breeding blanket. Advanced neutron transport calculations (MCNP) indicate a tritium breeding ratio of {$\sim$}1.08. The neutron damage rate (DPA/year) of the remote divertor targets is {$\sim$}3\textendash 30 times lower than that of the first wall. The entire VV (including divertor and first wall) can tolerate high damage rates since the demountable TF magnets allow the VV to be replaced every 1\textendash 2 years as a single unit, employing a vertical maintenance scheme. A tungsten swirl tube FLiBe coolant channel design, similar in geometry to that used by ITER, is considered for the divertor heat removal and shown capable of exhausting divertor heat flux levels of up to 12 MW/m2. Several novel, neutron tolerant diagnostics are explored for sensing power exhaust and for providing feedback control of divertor conditions over long time scales. These include measurement of Cherenkov radiation emitted in FLiBe to infer DT fusion reaction rate, measurement of divertor detachment front locations in the divertor legs with microwave interferometry, and monitoring ``hotspots'' on the divertor chamber walls via IR imaging through the FLiBe blanket.},

Alternating layers of Al2O3/SiO2 and HfO2/ SiO2 were grown on sapphire substrates and exposed to neutron doses of 1 and 4 displacements per atom (dpa) at 458 + 10 K in the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). In comparison to previously reported results, these higher doses of 1 and 4 dpa result in a drastic drop in optical reflectance, caused by a failure of the multilayer coating. HfO2/SiO2 mirrors failed completely when exposed to 1 dpa, whereas the reflectance of Al2O3/SiO2 mirrors reduced to 44\%, eventually failing at 4 dpa. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of the Al2O3/SiO2 specimens showed SiO2 layer defects, which increase in size with irradiation dose. The typical size of each defect was \&8 nm in 1-dpa specimens and \&42 nm in 4-dpa specimens. Buckling-type delamination of the interface between the substrate and first layer was typically observed in both 1- and 4-dpa HfO2/SiO2 specimens. Composition changes across the layers were measured in high-resolution-scanning\textendash TEM mode using energy dispersive spectroscopy. A significant interdiffusion between the film layers was observed in the Al2O3/SiO2 mirror, although it was less evident in the HfO2/SiO2 system. The ultimate goal of this work is to provide insight into the radiation-induced failure mechanisms of these mirrors.},

  abstract = {Achieving and sustaining long pulse and ultimately steady-state operation of a fusion reactor in terms of physics and engineering parameters beyond transient period is essentially one of key requirements in present non Deuterium Tritium (DT) discharge tokamaks. Since the successful long pulse operation for 25 s at the plasma current of 0.5 MA in 2013, the duration of the H-mode pulse length has been extended to over 70 s, which corresponds to a few multiples of the current diffusion time. In addition to long pulse operation, the plasma performance is enhanced further to high poloidal beta discharge. This characterizes a fully noninductive discharge longer than 12 s, and also achieves both ion and electron temperatures of over 5 keV simultaneously for a line-integrated electron density of 5\texttimes 1019/m3 and the plasma current of 0.8 MA. Recently, KSTAR reported the long pulse operation beyond 1 min at the injected power of about 5 MW and the plasma current of {$\sim$}0.5 MA. The normalized beta was about 1.5 and the total injected energy to the plasma reached to about 300 MJ. It is also shown that the bootstrap current fraction is about 40\% so that sufficient conditions are met for 100-s operation in terms of physics requirements of fully noninductive state. The plasma-facing components overheating issues due to prompt ion loss in the low plasma current operation was overcome by enlarging the outer gap between the plasma and outer poloidal limiter. An advanced tokamak scenario via profile control would be achieved with the new 6-MW neutral beam injection-2, and it is expected that 100-s operation can be possible in a fully noninductive manner at KSTAR. However, a reliable and innovative steady-state heating and current drive source is strongly recommended for achieving the final goal of the KSTAR.},

  abstract = {The antennas presently developed for ion cyclotron resonance frequency (ICRF) heating of the ITER plasma consist of a tightly packed array of a large number of radiating straps, in order to deliver a high power density without exceeding radio-frequency voltage standoffs. A recently developed three-dimensional electromagnetic commercial software has enabled important progress in the coupling analysis and optimization of such demanding systems. Approximations allowing these codes to convincingly model the effect of antenna loading by a magnetized plasma are discussed. It is shown that, for the purpose of antenna design calculations, a slab of ordinary dielectric with a high relative permittivity, KD, of the order of (c/VA)2, where VA is the plasma Alfve\textasciiacute n velocity, can reproduce the main features of wave reflection and refraction by the plasma edge. Multi-layered dielectrics permit more refined approximations. The numerical application of the approximation is illustrated by a simulation of the JET `A2' ICRF arrays, which fairly qualitatively reproduces the experimental frequency dependence of the coupling resistance. The same loading approximation is applied to the design of realistic experimental test-bed conditions for antenna prototypes or mock-ups, using water as a means of creating plasma-relevant antenna loading. Application to a scaled mockup of the ITER antenna is briefly presented.},

  abstract = {The demand for a predictive tool to help in designing ion-cyclotron radio frequency (ICRF) antenna systems for today's fusion experiments has driven the development of codes such as ICANT, RANT3D, and the early development of TOPICA (TOrino Polytechnic Ion Cyclotron Antenna) code. This paper describes the substantive evolution of TOPICA formulation and implementation that presently allow it to handle the actual geometry of ICRF antennas (with curved, solid straps, a general-shape housing, Faraday screen, etc) as well as an accurate plasma description, accounting for density and temperature profiles and finite Larmor radius effects. The antenna is assumed to be housed in a recess-like enclosure. Both goals have been attained by formally separating the problem into two parts: the vacuum region around the antenna and the plasma region inside the toroidal chamber. Field continuity and boundary conditions allow formulating of a set of two coupled integral equations for the unknown equivalent (current) sources; then the equations are reduced to a linear system by a method of moments solution scheme employing 2D finite elements defined over a 3D non-planar surface triangular-cell mesh. In the vacuum region calculations are done in the spatial (configuration) domain, whereas in the plasma region a spectral (wavenumber) representation of fields and currents is adopted, thus permitting a description of the plasma by a surface impedance matrix. Owing to this approach, any plasma model can be used in principle, and at present the FELICE code has been employed. The natural outcomes of TOPICA are the induced currents on the conductors (antenna, housing, etc) and the electric field in front of the plasma, whence the antenna circuit parameters (impedance/scattering matrices), the radiated power and the fields (at locations other than the chamber aperture) are then obtained. An accurate model of the feeding coaxial lines is also included. The theoretical model and its TOPICA implementation have been fully validated against measured data both in vacuo and in plasma-facing conditions for real-life structures.},

Scripting in the Python programming language can be a key tool for reaching these goals [27,29]. The term scripting means different things to different people. By scripting I mean developing programs of an administering nature, mostly to organize your work, using languages where the abstraction level is higher and program ming is more convenient than in Fortran, C, C++, or Java. Perl, Python, Ruby, Scheme, and Tel are examples of languages supporting such high-level programming or scripting. To some extent Matlab and similar scientific com puting environments also fall into this category, but these environments are mainly used for computing and visualization with built-in tools, while script ing aims at gluing a range of different tools for computing, visualization, data analysis, file/directory management, user interfaces, and Internet communi cation. So, although Matlab is perhaps the scripting language of choiee in computational science today, my use of the term scripting goes beyond typi cal Matlab scripts. Python stands out as the language of choice for scripting in computational science because of its very elean syntax, rieh modulariza tion features, good support for numerical computing, and rapidly growing popularity.

Operation of the LH launcher with the adjacent ICRF antenna significantly degrades LH coupling while operation with the ICRF antenna that is not magnetically connected to the LH launcher minimally affects LH coupling. An X-mode reflectometer system at three poloidal locations adjacent to the LH launcher and a visible video camera imaging the LH launcher are used to measure local SOL density profile and emissivity modifications with the application of LH and LH + ICRF power. These measurements confirm that the density in front of the LH launcher depends strongly on the magnetic field line mapping of the active ICRF antenna. Reflectometer measurements also observe both ICRF-driven and LH-driven poloidal density profile asymmetries, especially a strong density depletion at certain poloidal locations in front of the LH launcher during operation with a magnetically connected ICRF antenna. The results indicate that understanding both LH-driven flows and ICRF sheath driven flows may be necessary to understand the observed density profile modifications and LH coupling results during simultaneous LH + ICRF operation.},

Three synthetic turbulence models are evaluated to assess the impact of filaments, holes, and periodic fluctuations on the LH wave electric fields. For all three cases, the synthetic turbulence can greatly impact the LH wave magnitude and polarization. Back scattering, interference and edge/SOL absorption of the LH wave is observed. This impact is shown to depend on the wavelength and amplitude of the fluctuations. The strongest effect appears for fluctuations at high amplitudes and wavelengths comparable to the LH wavelength. This synthetic turbulence model can be used as inputs into a synthetic diagnostic to calculate the lower hybrid wave field magnitude and direction measured by dynamic Stark effect spectroscopy. It will be shown that fluctuations at these high amplitudes and wavelengths may explain the experimentally measured results. The effect of fluctuations on modifying LH polarization are also shown to be anti-correlated with SOL power losses, similar to recently observed experimental trends on Alcator C-Mod. These SOL losses may have detrimental impact on LHCD efficiency.},

All designs operate at a central frequency of 17.136 GHz and convert circular electric modes (TE0 ) from one radial mode to the next higher mode. The emphasis of the design study is to maximize the bandwidth of the device without sacrificing mode purity. Mode converters from the TE01 to TE02 mode and from the TE02 to TE03 mode were investigated in depth, and two designs, each with six periods, were constructed and tested. The nonuniform ripple seems to have a significant advantage over the constant ripple design for the higher mode converter, while the designs for the lower mode converter are comparable. Experimental measurements agree well with the theoretical results both in terms of bandwidth and mode content.},

This paper reviews the methods of microwave plasma generation at pressures from 10-2 approximately to 30\,kPa with centimeter\textendash millimeter wavelength microwaves on the basis of scientific publications since 1950 up to the present. The review consists of 16 sections. A general look at MDs and their application is given in the introduction, together with a description of a typical block-schema of the microwave plasma generator, classification of MD, and attractive features of MD. Sections 2\textendash 12 describe the different methods of microwave plasma generators on the basis of cavity and waveguide discharges, surface and slow wave discharges, discharges with distributed energy input, initiated and surface discharges, discharges in wave beams, discharges with stochastically jumping phases of microwaves, discharges in an external magnetic field and discharges with a combination of microwave field and dc and RF fields. These methods provide the possibility of producing nonequilibriun high density plasma in small and large chambers for many applications. Plasma chemical activity of nonequilibrium microwave plasma is analyzed in section 13. A short consideration of the history and status of the problem is given. The main areas of microwave plasma application are briefly described in section 14. Non-uniformity is the inherent property of the majority of electrical discharges and MDs are no exception. Peculiarities of physical\textendash chemical processes in strongly non-uniform MDs are demonstrated placing high emphasis on the influence of small noble gas additions to the main plasma gas (section 15). The review is illustrated by 80 figures. The list of references contains 350 scientific publications.},

Besides neutral beam injection (NBI), electron-cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) and lower hybrid wave heating (LH), ion-cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) is a promising candidate to drive current, in particular at the high temperatures expected in fusion plasmas. In this paper, the current drive (CD) efficiencies calculated with coupled ICRF wave / CD numerical codes for the DEMO-1 design case (R0=9m, B0=6.8T, ap=2.25m) [1] are presented. It will be shown that although realistic CD efficiencies can be obtained in the usual ICRF frequency domain (20-100MHz) by shifting the dominant ion-cyclotron absorption layers to the high-field side, operation at higher frequencies (100-300MHz) has a stronger CD potential, provided the parasitic RF power absorption of the alpha particles can be minimized.},

By fuelling the plasma from gas injection modules (GIMs) located in the mid-plane and on the top of the machine instead of adopting the more standardly used divertor GIMs, a considerable increase of the ICRF antenna coupling resistances was achieved with moderate gas injection rates ({$<$}1.5\texttimes 1022e/s). This effect is explained by an increase of the scrape-off-layer density in front of the antennas when mid-plane and top fuelling is used. By distributing the gas injection to optimize the coupling of all ICRF antenna arrays simultaneously, a substantial increase in the ICRF power capability and reliability was attained. Although similar core/pedestal plasma properties were observed for the different injection cases, the experiments indicate that the RF-induced impurity sources are reduced when switching from divertor to main chamber gas injection.},

  abstract = {The superconducting stellarator Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) is a fusion device, which is capable of steady state operation. Furthermore W7-X is a very complex technical system. To cope with these requirements a modular and strongly hierarchical component-based control and data acquisition system has been designed. The behavior of W7-X is characterized by thousands of technical parameters of the participating components. The intended sequential change of those parameters during an experiment is defined in an experiment program. Planning such an experiment program is a crucial and complex task. To reduce the complexity an abstract, more physics-oriented high-level layer has been introduced earlier. The so-called high-level (physics) parameters are used to encapsulate technical details. This contribution will focus on the extension of this layer to a high-level component model. It completely describes the behavior of a component for a certain period of time. It allows not only defining simple value ranges but also complex dependencies between physics parameters. This can be: dependencies within components, dependencies between components or temporal dependencies. Component models can now be analyzed to generate various views of an experiment. A first implementation of such an analyze process is already finished. A graphical preview of a planned discharge can be generated from a chronological sequence of component models. This allows physicists to survey complex planned experiment programs at a glance.},

To design a new ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) antenna in LHD, calculation for a simple antenna model is conducted using three-dimensional electrical magnetic code (high frequency structure simulator, HFSS) for an water loading as an imaginary plasma with low heating efficiency. At resonant frequencies, antenna loading is sensitive to strap width, and resonant frequencies are strongly related to strap height. There is no differences of RF current profile on the strap surface between resonant frequency and non-resonant frequency. The strap should be perpendicularly placed against the magnetic field line, since Faraday-shield angle will lead to a decrease in the effective antenna height.},

The result of the simulations of the electric field shows that the power capacity of the multi-stepped structure is more than twice compared with the traditional design. Moreover, the divider shows excellent performance in the low-power test, with low return loss (-35 dB) and similar division ratio (S21 = -3.004 dB and S31 = -3.035 dB) at 4.6 GHz. Both the division ratio test and the full reflection test were carried out successfully under 250-kW CW, which suggests that the development of the 3-dB divider satisfies the design requirements.},

The former prototypical FFT system on the E-port 2-strap antenna has been upgraded using new ferrite tuners that have been designed specifically for the operational parameters of the Alcator C-Mod ICRF system (\textasciitilde{} 80 MHz). Another similar FFT system, with two ferrite tuners and one fixed-length stub, has been installed on the transmission line of the D-port 2-strap antenna. These two systems share a Linux-server-based real-time controller. These FFT systems are able to achieve and maintain the reflected power to the transmitters to less than 1\% in real time during the plasma discharges under almost all plasma conditions, and help ensure reliable high power operation of the antennas. The innovative field-aligned (FA) 4-strap antenna on J-port has been found to have an interesting feature of loading insensitivity vs. plasma conditions. This feature allows us to significantly improve the matching for the FA J-port antenna by installing carefully designed stubs on the two transmission lines. The reduction of the RF voltages in the transmission lines has enabled the FA J-port antenna to deliver 3.7 MW RF power to plasmas out of the 4 MW source power in high performance I-mode plasmas.},

Simple and accurate methods for propagation constant calculations for isotropic as well as anisotropic dielectric waveguides are described. Both analytical and numerical approaches are covered. Different types of transitions have been simulated in order to find optimal configurations as well as optimal dimensions of dielectric waveguides for the frequency band of 75-110 GHz. Simple and effective design is presented. The experimental studies of dielectric waveguides show that Sapphire waveguide can be utilized for this frequency band as a very low-loss waveguide.

  author = {Liptac, John E},
  year = {2006},
  abstract = {A highly flexible phase control system was developed in order to dynamically adjust the parallel wave number spectrum of driven LH waves on Alcator C-Mod. Wave coupling between the antenna and the plasma was studied using this system. A coupling code was modified to allow arbitrary phase and amplitude in each waveguide, which was required for agreement between the theory and experiment. Remarkable agreement was achieved when a small vacuum gap of 0.6 to 1.4 mm was included in the model, similar to results obtained on ASDEX. The location of the fast electron population is critical in diagnosing the performance of the lower hybrid system and can be inferred by measuring nonthermal bremsstrahlung emission. A state-of-the-art diagnostic for hard x-ray (HXR) emission was designed and used to make measurements of fast electrons bremsstrahlung during LHCD experiments on C-Mod. The HXR diagnostic consists of an array of 32 CdZnTe detectors to image energies in the 20-200 keV range. Detectors and pulse processing electronics were integrated into a compact and modular package. The system also makes use of fast digitization and software signal processing techniques allowing a maximum counting rate of 1 MHz. HXR experimental results indicate a spatially broad and centered fast electron population. HXR profiles predicted by a synthetic diagnostic in the Fokker-Planck code CQL3D are narrower than the observed profiles, suggesting the importance of spatial diffusion of fast electrons in the experiment. Lower hybrid experiments on C-Mod represent the first results obtained with density, magnetic field, plasma shape, and source frequency all near conditions expected on ITER. In initial experiments, about 400 kW of LH power was coupled for 400 ms into low density L-mode discharges. Clear evidence of current drive was seen as the loop voltage decreased by about 50\%. Studies were performed by varying the phase, density, and magnetic field as well as changing the direction that the waves were launched. Analysis using CQL3D indicates that a current drive efficiency of 0.15 (1020 m-2A/W ) was obtained by driving 167 kA of LH current with 410 kW at a line-average density of 5.5\texttimes 1019 m-3, without an electric field. This efficiency exceeds what was observed on Alcator C, but is within the range observed on FTU for similar densities. Including the residual electric field increased the LH driven current to 308 kA, corresponding to an increased effective efficiency of 0.28. In addition to experiments, extensive modeling of current profile control through phase variation was studied, including compound spectra, using CQL3D. It was found that over 200 kA of off-axis LH current can be generated in a variety of profile shapes in an H-mode target plasma. Finally, time dependent modeling of an integrated scenario was performed using the transport code TRANSP to explore what performance can be ultimately achieved on C-Mod. Results indicate that fully non-inductive, quasi-steady-state plasmas are possible with bootstrap fractions as high as 75\%.},

  abstract = {The TORE SUPRA lower hybrid current drive experiments (8 MWi3.7 GHz) use large phased waveguide arrays, four rows of 32 active waveguides and two passive waveguides for each of the two grills, to couple the waves to the plasma. These launchers are based on the `multijunction' principle which allows them to be quite compact and is therefore attractive for the design of efficient multi-megawatt antennas in NETIITER. Extensive coupling measurements have been performed in order to study the radiofrequency (RF) characteristics of the plasma loaded antennas. Measurements of the plasma scattering coefficients of the antennas show good agreement with those obtained from the linear coupling theory (SWAN code). Global reflection coefficients of a few per cent have been measured in a large range of edge plasma densities (0.3 X 10'' m-3 I neg I 1.4 X 10l8m-3) or antenna positions (0.02-0.05 m from the plasma edge) and up to a maximum injected RF power density of 45 MWlm'. When the plasma is pushed against the inner wall of the chamber, the reflection coefficient is found to remain low up to distances of the order of 0.10 m. The coupling measurements allow us to deduce the `experimental' power spectra radiated by the antennas when all their modules are fed simultaneously with variable phases. Thus, the multijunction launcher is assessed as a viable antenna for high power transmission with good coupling characteristics and spectrum control.},

  abstract = {Mirrors will be used as first plasma-viewing elements in optical and laser-based diagnostics in ITER. Deterioration of the mirror performance due to e.g. sputtering of the mirror surface by plasma particles or deposition of impurities will hamper the entire performance of the affected diagnostic and thus affect ITER operation. The Specialists Working Group on First Mirrors (FM SWG) in the Topical Group on Diagnostics of the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) plays an important role in finding solutions for diagnostic first mirrors. Sound progress in research and development of diagnostic mirrors in ITER was achieved since the last overview in 2009. Single crystal (SC) rhodium (Rh) mirrors became available. SC rhodium and molybdenum (Mo) mirrors survived in conditions corresponding to 200 cleaning cycles with a negligible degradation of reflectivity. These results are important for a mirror cleaning system which is presently under development. The cleaning system is based on sputtering of contaminants by plasma. Repetitive cleaning was tested on several mirror materials. Experiments comprised contamination/cleaning cycles. The reflectivity SC Mo and Rh mirrors has changed insignificantly after 80 cycles. First in situ cleaning using radiofrequency (RF) plasma was conducted in EAST tokamak with a mock-up plate of ITER edge Thomson Scattering (ETS) with five inserted mirrors. Contaminants from the mirrors were removed. Physics of cleaning discharge was studied both experimentally and by modeling. Mirror contamination can also be mitigated by protecting diagnostic ducts. A deposition mitigation (DeMi) duct system was exposed in KSTAR. The real-time measurement of deposition in the diagnostic duct was pioneered during this experiment. Results evidenced the dominating effect of the wall conditioning and baking on contamination inside the duct. A baffled cassette with mirrors was exposed at the main wall of JET for 23,6 plasma hours. No significant degradation of reflectivity was measured on mirrors located in the ducts. Predictive modeling was further advanced. A model for the particle transport, deposition and erosion at the port-plug was used in selecting an optical layout of several ITER diagnostics. These achievements contributed to the focusing of the first mirror research thus accelerating the diagnostic development. Modeling requires more efforts. Remaining crucial issues will be in a focus of the future work of the FM SWG.},

          , 
            Increasing research effort has been made aiming at developing electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials with high absorption performance. An ideal EM absorber should be relatively light-weight, thermally stable, capable of absorbing wide EM frequency, and cost effective. As a dielectric material, silicon carbide (SiC) has great potential with relatively low density, good thermal and chemical resistance, and it can function at high temperatures or under harsh working environments. This review summarizes the research progress in the design and characterization of SiC and SiC based composites as EM absorption materials. Pristine SiC with various morphological, phase, and structural features can be tailored to achieve better absorption performance. Moreover, SiC based materials can either be modified using dielectric or magnetic materials, or be designed with variation in geometry, composition, and mass fraction of the filler composition for further improvement in EM absorption. This review intends to inspire new concepts and approaches for designing excellent EM absorbing materials.},

  abstract = {Tore Supra is a superconducting limiter tokamak designed for long and high-power discharges. In its initial phase, the plasma density control was handled by a set of seven modular limiters (total area ;1.5 m2) equipped with pumps. An inner wall (;10 m2), covered with actively cooled carbon tiles, was used to handle high-power discharges. An ergodic divertor (ED), composed of six modules, was installed on the low-field side to create a stochastic edge layer for enhancing the edge radiation; all the modules were equipped with neutralizer plates and a pumping system. The performances, in terms of pumping capabilities and density control, are reported for the modular pump limiters and the ED modules, equipped with neutralizer plates for particle collection. Throat and vented geometries, respectively collecting ions and neutrals, were tested for the modular limiters and the ED. After 12 years of operation, a major upgrade (Composants Internes et Limiteur project) resulted in the replacement of all these plasma-facing components by a flat toroidal pump limiter (total area ;7.6 m2) actively cooled and located at the bottom of the machine. Long discharges (6 min) with high energy input (Ͼ1.0 GJ) have been performed repetitively, in steady-state conditions.},

This antenna must perform several tasks in a long term physics programme: fast particles generation, heating at high densities, current drive and ICRH physics studies. Various minority heating scenarios are considered and two frequency bands will be used. In the present work a design for the low frequency range (25\textendash 38 MHz) only is developed. The antenna is made of 2 straps with tap feeds and tuning capacitors with DC capacitance in the range 15\textendash 200 pF. These capacitors introduce additional constraints on the optimisation and on the maximum amount of power that can be coupled to the plasma: not only the capacitor voltages cannot exceed a certain value (42 kV) but also the currents are limited to approximately 740 A rms to ensure sufficient heat dissipation for the considered duty cycle. Starting from an initial geometry we used the tridimensional electromagnetic software CST MicroWave Studio (MWS) to assess and optimise its coupling properties. By modifying some geometrical parameters of the front face (strap width, antenna box depth, strap length, strap feeders shape), we show that a substantial increase in maximum coupled power can be obtained accounting for the technical constraints on the capacitors. The various steps of the optimisation are validated with TOPICA simulations. For a given density profile the RF power coupling expectancy can be precisely computed.},

  abstract = {Detailed designs of ICRF antennas were made possible by the development of sophisticated commercial 3D codes like CST Microwave Studio R (MWS). This program allows for very detailed geometries of the radiating structures, but was only considering simple materials like equivalent isotropic dielectrics to simulate the reflection and the refraction of RF waves at the vacuum/plasma interface. The code was nevertheless used intensively, notably for computing the coupling properties of the ITER ICRF antenna. Until recently it was not possible to simulate gyrotropic medias like magnetized plasmas, but recent improvements have allowed programming any material described by a general dielectric or/and diamagnetic tensor. A Visual Basic macro was developed to exploit this feature and was tested for the specific case of a monochromatic plane wave propagating longitudinally with respect to the magnetic field direction. For specific cases the exact solution can be expressed in 1D as the sum of two circularly polarized waves connected by a reflection coefficient that can be analytically computed. Solutions for stratified media can also be derived. This allows for a direct comparison with MWS results. The agreement is excellent but accurate simulations for realistic geometries require large memory resources that could significantly restrict the possibility of simulating cold plasmas to small-scale machines.},

  abstract = {In order to model the sheath rectification in a realistic geometry over the size of ion cyclotron resonant heating (ICRH) antennas, the self-consistent sheaths and waves for ICH (SSWICH) code couples self-consistently the RF wave propagation and the DC SOL biasing via nonlinear RF and DC sheath boundary conditions applied at plasma/wall interfaces. A first version of SSWICH had 2D (toroidal and radial) geometry, rectangular walls either normal or parallel to the confinement magnetic field B0 and only included the evanescent slow wave (SW) excited parasitically by the ICRH antenna. The main wave for plasma heating, the fast wave (FW) plays no role on the sheath excitation in this version. A new version of the code, 2D SSWICH-full wave, was developed based on the COMSOL software, to accommodate full RF field polarization and shaped walls tilted with respect to B0. SSWICH-full wave simulations have shown the mode conversion of FW into SW occurring at the sharp corners where the boundary shape varies rapidly. It has also evidenced `far-field' sheath oscillations appearing at the shaped walls with a relatively long magnetic connection length to the antenna, that are only accessible to the propagating FW. Joint simulation, conducted by SSWICH-full wave within a multi-2D approach excited using the 3D wave coupling code (RAPLICASOL), has recovered the double-hump poloidal structure measured in the experimental temperature and potential maps when only the SW is modelled. The FW contribution on the potential poloidal structure seems to be affected by the 3D effects, which was ignored in the current stage. Finally, SSWICH-full wave simulation revealed the left\textendash right asymmetry that has been observed extensively in the unbalanced strap feeding experiments, suggesting that the spatial proximity effects in RF sheath excitation, studied for SW only previously, is still important in the vicinity of the wave launcher under full wave polarizations.},

The ageing of electrical connectors with Multilams depending on stress relaxation is researched by long-term studies and FEM-calculations along with various material investigations. Experimental setups consist each of two plain and bolted pressure plates with inlaid strips of Multilams. The spring deflection is adjusted by ceramic spacers and can be assumed as constant. These samples are aged by electrical current or thermal heating at several temperatures up to 115 \textdegree C. The joint resistances and the remaining spring forces are measured time-dependent to evaluate the influence of stress relaxation on the long-term behaviour of plug-in connectors with copper beryllium contact lamellas.},

The numerical model whose generality allows to study the effect of various types of fluctuations, including those with short characteristic wavelengths is validated against a coupling code in quiescent regimes. When electron density fluctuations along the toroidal direction are incorporated in the dielectric tensor over a thin perturbed layer in front of the grill, the power spectrum may be strongly modified from the antenna mouth to the plasma separatrix as the LH wave propagates. The diffraction effect by density fluctuations leads to the appearance of multiple satellite lobes with randomly varying positions and the averaged perturbation is found to be maximum for the Fourier components of the fluctuating spectrum in the vicinity of the launched LH wavelength. This highlights that fast toroidal inhomogeneities with short characteristics length scales in front of the grill may change significantly the initial LH power spectrum used in coupled ray-tracing and Fokker\textendash Planck calculations.},

The CFC surface was coated with a thin titanium layer and was plated with copper in order to reduce RF losses, to bond rods and septum plates and to assemble them with cooling channel. The RF losses and the outgassing rates of this CFC module at high RF power were measured during long pulses. When the injected power varies between 30 and 100 kW, the RF losses measured by calorimetery, were found to be in the range of 1.0\textendash 1.2\%.

The method is based on the integral-equation formulation of the boundary-value problem, solved via a weighted-residual scheme. The antenna geometry (including Faraday shield bars and a recess box) is fairly general and three-dimensional (3D), and the plasma is in the one-dimensional (1D) `slab' approximation; finite-Larmor radius effects, as well as plasma density and temperature gradients, are considered. Feeding via the voltages in the access coaxial lines is selfconsistently accounted throughout and the impedance or scattering matrix of the antenna array obtained therefrom. The problem is formulated in both the dual space (physical) and spectral (wavenumber) domains, which allows the extraction and simple handling of the terms that slow the convergence in the spectral domain usually employed. This paper includes validation tests of the developed code against measured data, both in vacuo and in the presence of plasma. An example of application to a complex geometry is also given.},

  abstract = {Fusion energy research is `mission oriented' big-science. It has both rapid progress and a reputation for being forever distant that excites many with a curiosity for science. However, it is difficult to give time to in lesson plans given both its lack of associated learning objectives and complexity. Outreach at the Fusion Centre for Doctoral Training (FCDT) tries to make fusion accessible. We describe here a set of questions, which we use in workshops, that build a picture of fusion research. Each question integrates one or more aspects of the core science curriculum. We further share our experience of engagement with these questions and the rewarding experience pupils get on realising they can apply their knowledge to cutting-edge science. There is broad scope for using the worksheets. The available materials are a self-contained set of numerical questions that explore physics and fusion, providing all necessary equations and constants. The themes and physics of each sheet can be a springboard, though, for further exploration. Prompts for such discussion are suggested in this article for the first time, as they are not included in the available question set. Our questions, then, can be used to revise physics lessons in an interesting, unseen context; to explore the exciting world of fusion energy itself or as a workshop for the physics of energy. The full set of worksheets (one per question) is available upon request from .},

  abstract = {Ion cyclotron resonance frequencies (ICRF) mode conversion has been developed for localized on-axis and off-axis bulk electron heating on the JET tokamak. The fast magnetosonic waves launched from the low-field side ICRF antennas are mode-converted to short-wavelength waves on the high-field side of the 3He ion cyclotron resonance layer in D and 4He plasmas and subsequently damped on the bulk electrons. The resulting electron power deposition, measured using ICRF power modulation, is narrow with a typical full-width at half-maximum of {$\approx$}30 cm (i.e. about 30\% of the minor radius) and the total deposited power to electrons comprises at least up to 80\% of the applied ICRF power. The ICRF mode conversion power deposition has been kept constant using 3He bleed throughout the ICRF phase with a typical duration of 4\textendash 6 s, i.e. 15\textendash 40 energy confinement times. Using waves propagating in the counter-current direction minimizes competing ion damping in the presence of co-injected deuterium beam ions.},

  abstract = {An Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequency (ICRF) system with a radio frequency (RF) power of 4\texttimes 1.5 MW was developed for the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). High RF power transmitters were designed as a part of the research and development (R\&D) for an ICRF system with long pulse operation at megawatt levels in a frequency range of 25 MHz to 70 MHz. Studies presented in this paper cover the following parts of the high power transmitter: the three staged high power amplifier, which is composed of a 5 kW wideband solid state amplifier, a 100 kW tetrode drive stage amplifier and a 1.5 MW tetrode final stage amplifier, and the DC high voltage power supply (HVPS). Based on engineering design and static examinations, the RF transmitters were tested using a matched dummy load where an RF output power of 1.5 MW was achieved. The transmitters provide 6 MW RF power in primary phase and will reach a level up to 12 MW after a later upgrade. The transmitters performed successfully in stable operations in EAST and HT-7 devices. Up to 1.8 MW of RF power was injected into plasmas in EAST ICRF heating experiments during the 2010 autumn campaign and plasma performance was greatly improved.},

This paper gives an overview of the mechanical analysis, modeling and design carried out on two major elements of the antenna: the grill front face, and the RF feed-through or windows. The front face will have to withstand high heat and fast neutrons fluxes directly from the plasma. It will be actively cooled and present a beryllium coating upon ITER requirement. The RF window being a critical safety importance class component (SIC) because of its tritium confinement function, two of them will be put in series on each line to achieve a double barrier. A design of a water cooled 5 GHz CW RF ``pillbox'' window capable of sustaining 500 kW of transmitted power is proposed. Both studies allow to move forward, and focus on critical issues, such as manufacturing processes and R\&D associated programs including tests of mock-ups.},

The reflectivity measurements showed the dependence of the thickness of the deposited film on the optical properties of the mirror: a thinner film on the Mo mirrors results in an identical reduction in reflectivity as that seen on the exposed Rh mirror.},

A gold (Au) mirror was deposited with 185\textendash 285 nm of amorphous carbon (aC:D) film coming from the carbon tiles of TCV. Another molybdenum (Mo) mirror had a thicker deposit due to a different location within the tokamak. The thickness measurements were carried out using ellipsometry and the reflectivity measurements performed by spectrophotometry revealed a decrease of the specular reflectivity in the entire range (250\textendash 2500 nm) for the Mo mirror and specifically in the visible spectrum for the Au. Comparison of the simulated reflectivity using a refractive index of 1.5 and a Cauchy model for the aC:D gives good confidence on the estimated film thickness. Plasma cleaning using radio frequency directly applied to a metallic plate where the mirrors were fixed demonstrated the ability to remove the carbon deposits. A mixture of 50\% hydrogen and 50\% helium was used with a -200 V self-bias. Due to the low sputtering yield of He and the low chemical erosion of hydrogen leading to volatile molecules, 20 h of cleaning were needed for Au mirror and more than 60 h for Mo mirror. Recovery of the reflectivity was not complete for the Au mirror most likely due to damage of the surface during tokamak exposure (breakdown phenomena).},

Following the recent addition of new data, the improvement of existing data and the improvement of selection criteria, a revised scaling law that describes the threshold power required to obtain an L-mode to H-mode transition is presented. Predictions for ITER give a threshold power of \textasciitilde 52MW in a deuterium plasma at a line average density ne = 0.5\texttimes 1020m-3. At the nominal ITER H-mode density, ne = 1.0\texttimes 1020m-3, the threshold power required is \textasciitilde 86MW. Detailed analysis of data from individual devices suggests that the density dependence of the threshold power might increase with the plasma size and the magnetic field. On the other hand, the density at which the threshold power is minimal is found to decrease with the plasma size and increase with magnetic field. The influence of these effects on the accessibility of the H-mode regime in ITER plasmas is discussed. Analyses of the confinement database show that, in present day devices, H-modes are generally maintained with powers exceeding the threshold power by a factor larger than 1.5, and that, on the other hand, good confinement can be obtained close to the threshold power although rarely demonstrated.},

  abstract = {A fusion nuclear science facility (FNSF) could play an important role in the development of fusion energy by providing the nuclear environment needed to develop fusion materials and components. The spherical torus/tokamak (ST) is a leading candidate for an FNSF due to its potentially high neutron wall loading and modular configuration. A key consideration for the choice of FNSF configuration is the range of achievable missions as a function of device size. Possible missions include: providing high neutron wall loading and fluence, demonstrating tritium self-sufficiency, and demonstrating electrical self-sufficiency. All of these missions must also be compatible with a viable divertor, first-wall, and blanket solution. ST-FNSF configurations have been developed simultaneously incorporating for the first time: (1) a blanket system capable of tritium breeding ratio TBR\,\,{$\approx$}\,\,1, (2) a poloidal field coil set supporting high elongation and triangularity for a range of internal inductance and normalized beta values consistent with NSTX/NSTX-U previous/planned operation, (3) a long-legged divertor analogous to the MAST-U divertor which substantially reduces projected peak divertor heat-flux and has all outboard poloidal field coils outside the vacuum chamber and superconducting to reduce power consumption, and (4) a vertical maintenance scheme in which blanket structures and the centerstack can be removed independently. Progress in these ST-FNSF missions versus configuration studies including dependence on plasma major radius R0 for a range 1 m\textendash 2.2 m are described. In particular, it is found the threshold major radius for TBR\,\,=\,\,1 is R0 {$\geqslant$} 1.7 m, and a smaller R0\,\,=\,\,1 m ST device has TBR\,\,{$\approx$}\,\,0.9 which is below unity but substantially reduces T consumption relative to not breeding. Calculations of neutral beam heating and current drive for non-inductive ramp-up and sustainment are described. An A\,\,=\,\,2, R0\,\,=\,\,3 m device incorporating high-temperature superconductor toroidal field coil magnets capable of high neutron fluence and both tritium and electrical self-sufficiency is also presented following systematic aspect ratio studies.},

  abstract = {The new Alcator C-Mod LHCD system (LH2) is based on the concept of a four way splitter [1] which evenly splits the RF power among the four waveguides that compose one of the 16 columns of the LH grill. In this work several simulation tools have been used to study the LH2 coupling performance and the launched spectra when facing a plasma, numerically verifying the effectiveness of the four way splitter concept and further improving its design. The TOPLHA code has been used for modeling reflections at the antenna/plasma interface. TOPLHA results have been then coupled to the commercial code CST Microwave Studio to efficiently optimize the four way splitter geometry for several plasma scenarios. Subsequently, the COMSOL Multiphysics code has been used to self consistently take into account the electromagnetic-thermal-structural interactions. This comprehensive and predictive analysis has proven to be very valuable for understanding the behavior of the system when facing the plasma and has profoundly influenced several design choices of the LH2. According to the simulations, the final design ensures even poloidal power splitting for a wide range of plasma parameters, which ultimately results in an improvement of the wave coupling and an increased maximum operating power.},

The model consists of a surface deformation computation which determines the actual contact area and number of contacting asperities at a joint, and a constriction resistance analysis which determines the constriction resistance through each individual contacting asperity. Predictions from the model are validated against experiments conducted for the purpose. The experiments are performed according to a Design of Experiments approach, and evaluated using statistical regression. Three substrates (copper, brass, and aluminum) and three coatings (silver, nickel and tin) are considered with a variety of coating thicknesses and substrate roughnesses. The contact load is also varied. The experimental measurements show that the best choice of a coating for contact resistance mitigation depends on the substrate material and roughness, and cannot be prescribed in general. A regression equation developed for the experimental results offers a useful tool for the design of coated contacts. The measured results agree well with predicted values from the numerical model, especially in cases of a rough substrate or hard coating.},

It presents some basic theory and describes a test method and the required equipment. Cold welding between two contacting surfaces can occur under conditions of impact or fretting. These surfaces may be bare metals, or inorganically or organically coated metals and their alloys. Standard procedures for quantifying the propensity of material surface pairs to cold weld to each other are proposed. Of particular interest will be the contact data of different materials, which are presented in numerical form and as tables summarising contacts between materials that can be either recommended or considered unsuitable for use under vacuum.

After an elementary review of the basics of charge-exchange, of typical spectra, of intended measurements and of the expected associated background, the DNB (diagnostic neutral beam) is briefly presented. The light collection and transport to the ex-vessel fibres and spectrometers constitutes the main part of this contribution: building on existing telescope and endoscope systems, the choice of a suitable optical layout for the core-plasma CXRS diagnostic at ITER is discussed. An account follows of the protective measures against the degradation of the first mirror, which will be exposed to high particle and heat fluxes: an appropriate duct, a shutter and, possibly, a cleaning discharge with ``End-of-Cleaning Indicator''.},

  abstract = {A mock-up of the complete antenna array (24 straps grouped in 8 triplets) of the ICRH system with external matching for ITER has been constructed with a length reduction factor of 5. At a frequency increased by the same factor the electrical properties of the full-scale system can be measured in the presence of non-dispersive medium. A movable water tank in front of the array simulates variable plasma loading. Measurements of the matching performances of various external circuit configurations and of the scattering matrix of the system show (i) the non-negligible effect of mutual coupling on load resilient matching by Conjugate T (CT) or hybrid leading to coupling between the matching actuators and the generators and asymmetry in power distribution, (ii) good load resilience of a single CT for the right choice of configuration and number of matching parameters, (iii) the large number of matching solutions for coupled CTs and (iv) the benefit of passive power distribution to the straps. This has been successfully tested in the case of the complete array. The power is passively distributed among the upper half and the bottom half of the 24 radiating straps of the antenna plug. The 4 top and 4 bottom triplets are, respectively, set in parallel outside the antenna plug near a voltage anti-node by means of T junctions. The load resilient matching (VSWR {$<$} 1.3 for an antenna loading variation of about 1\textendash 8 m-1) is then obtained by a 4-parameters single CT configuration or a hybrid. The maximum voltage along the line remains equal to the one in the antenna plug and there is a fair power share between the straps. A straightforward robust matching procedure of the complete array is described.},

From this analysis the following system characteristics can be derived: (1) a roughly constant power capability in the entire 40\textendash 55 MHz frequency band with the same maximum voltage in the eight feeding lines is obtained for all the considered heating and current drive phasings on account of the broadbanding effect of service stubs. (2) The power capability of the array significantly depends on the distance of the antenna to the separatrix, the density profile in the scrape-off layer (SOL) and on the strap current toroidal and poloidal phasings. The dependence on phasing is stronger for wider SOL. (3) To exceed a radiated power capability of 20 MW per antenna array in the upper part of the frequency band, with a separatrix\textendash wall distance of 17 cm and a conservative short decay plasma edge density profile, the system voltage stand-off must be 45 kV and well chosen combinations of toroidal and poloidal phasing are needed. (4) On account of the plasma gyrotropy and of poloidal magnetic field, special care must be taken in choosing the optimal toroidal current drive and poloidal phasings.},

The aim of this study is to understand the key physics phenomena contributing to the coupling. It is shown that the following plasma density profile characteristics are decisive: (i) distance between the antenna and the wave cutoff density, (ii) position of an optimum density with respect to the cutoff one and (iii) the density gradient leading from this optimum density to the plasma bulk. At each step of the analysis approximate relations are derived and the loading due to the plasma is compared with that of an isotropic dielectric medium in view of the application for modelling or dummy load testing. Examples are taken starting from the case of the projected ITER antenna array with its different phasing cases in front of the plasma edge profile used in the conceptual design phase. It is shown that, for the same antenna\textendash cutoff distance, slight profile modifications can lead to substantial coupling and therefore power capability variations. Stronger profile modifications and some critically shaped resonant edge profiles are also analysed. The usefulness of a dielectric medium to simulate plasma loading is discussed in an appendix.},

There is the same determining dependence on the following plasma density and dielectric constant KD profile characteristics of the coupling performances: (i) distance antenna-cutoff layer and position of an optimum density or dielectric constant value layer with respect to the cutoff one (ii) their gradient between this optimum layer and the bulk regions. The best simulation of the considered ITER profiles (for frequency response and quantitative coupling measurements for the different toroidal phasing cases) is obtained by the relation KD(x) = 1 + ({$\omega$}pi(x))2/({$\omega\omega$}ci(x) + {$\omega$}c2i(x)) (KD(x) = {$\epsilon$}1 - {$\epsilon$}2 for multispecies plasma) which puts the plasma and dielectric cutoff for all toroidal wavenumbers at the same position. Effects of dielectric losses are discussed. Good simulation of the frequency response is also obtained for most of the phasing cases with a homogeneous dielectric as water but a larger value of KD ={$\sim$} 200 would cover all cases. Varying the distance antenna-homogeneous dielectric load can scan a large loading domain covering the one expected for ITER. Illustrations from measurements with the ITER mock-up are given.},

  abstract = {The eight triplets of straps of the ITER ICRF antenna array are fed through 8 matching circuits and 4 hybrids to ensure load resilience. Decouplers are used to mitigate the effects of triplet mutual coupling. They also control the array phasing. The electrical constraints on the decouplers for different layouts with heating (H) or current drive (CD) phasing are compared starting from the TOPICA matrix computed for the last antenna plug design and the reference (most pessimistic) plasma profile ``2010low'' provided by IO. It is shown that this last profile provides a significant decrease of plasma coupling and increase of mutual coupling with respect to the previous reference profile ``Sc2short17''. This results in a larger range of decoupler reactance Xdec and voltage VXdec needed. This range can be reduced when using 10 decouplers instead of the 7 needed for the same forward power PGk+ of the 4 power sources. For H phasing only 4 decouplers could be used but with different PGk+ (PGk+ ratio up to 1.5\textendash 2.5). For CD phasing and same plasma profile the power capability Ptot is increased by 25\% with a decoupler layout allowing much smaller poloidal phasing than the 90{$\smwhtcircle$} provided by the hyb{$\surd$}rids. A decrease of the distance antenna-plasma profile reduces the normalized decoupler voltage VXdec/ Ptot with no significant change of the Xdec range. The recess of the vertical septa between the strap boxes increases the plasma coupling but has the dra{$\surd$}wback of also increasing the mutual coupling between triplets: the needed range of Xdec and of VXdec/ Ptot is increased in proportion.},

  abstract = {The new ICRF antenna concept proposed in Milanesio and Maggiora (2014) has been confirmed. In the ANTITER II code a layer of low loss dielectric replaces the artificial dielectric covering the back-plate of the antenna box. This allows producing any surface impedance ZS at the dielectric boundary. The W7-X antenna is taken as a reference example. High Q resonances are obtained for discrete values of ZS at a given frequency. They correspond to TEn,0 cavity modes of the antenna box, partially filled with dielectric. These resonances can occur when the wave of the considered mode is propagating into the dielectric and evanescent in the vacuum part. The conclusions of the modelling have been experimentally verified on an antenna box partially filled with a dielectric; excited either by a strap or a side loop and loaded by a salted water dummy load. The high Q resonances are damped by the dummy load at the aperture of the antenna box but also by the losses in the dielectric. The loading also shifts their resonance frequencies. Therefore: (i) resonance tracking is mandatory either by acting on the dielectric (or equivalent one) or on the generator frequency, (ii) very low loss dielectric or equivalent artificial one is needed to avoid the dissipation of a significant part of the power in it. The strap is not needed to excite the resonance: appropriate side loops can be used and designed to be close to matching for the average loading condition.},

We discuss a method to accurately predict the tuning capacitance values in the presence of plasma operation and for efficiently accounting for the capacitors in the performance analysis.

In fact, by formally separating the structure's cavities with a number of mathematical surfaces called `apertures', the method of moments interaction matrix is block-wise sparse and, as a consequence, can be manipulated with a far higher numerical efficiency; this also allows an out-of-core solution.},

  abstract = {The yellow-legged Asian hornet is an invasive species of wasps, indigenous to the Southeast Asia but recently spreading in Southern Europe. Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honeybee colonies (and to humans as well), restraint measures are currently under investigation. We developed and tested an harmonic radar capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. Several hornets were captured close to a small cluster of honeybee hives, tagged with different transponders and then released in order to follow the flight toward their nest. On-field testing proved an initial maximum detection range of about 125 m in a hilly and woody area. A number of detections were clearly recorded, and preferential directions of flight were identified. The system herein described is intended as a first low-cost harmonic radar; it proved the capability to track the hornets while flying and it permitted to test the tagging techniques. Several upgrades of the system have been identified during this work and are extensively described in the last chapter. The designed system has three major advantages over conventional harmonic radars. First and most importantly, it adopts advanced processing techniques to suppress clutter and to improve target detection. Second, it allows radar operations in complex environments, generally hilly and rich in vegetation. Finally, it can continuously track tagged insects (24/7) and in any meteorological condition, providing an effective tool in order to locate the nests of the yellow-legged Asian hornet.},

  abstract = {To simulate traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) in time domain and more generally the wave-particle interaction in vacuum devices, we developed DIMOHA as an alternative to current particle-in-cell (PIC) and frequency approaches. Indeed, it is based on a longitudinal N -body Hamiltonian approach satisfying Maxwell's equations. Advantages of DIMOHA include: (i) it allows arbitrary waveform (not just field envelope), including continuous waveform (CW), multiple carriers or digital modulations (shift keying); (ii) the algorithm is much faster than PIC codes thanks to a field discretization allowing a drastic degree-of-freedom reduction, along with a robust symplectic integrator; (iii) it supports any periodic slow-wave structure design such as helix or folded waveguides; (iv) it reproduces harmonic generation, reflection, oscillation and distortion phenomena; (v) it handles nonlinear dynamics, including intermodulations, trapping and chaos. DIMOHA accuracy is assessed by comparing it against measurements from a commercial Ku-band tapered helix TWT and against simulations from a sub-THz folded waveguide TWT with a staggered double-grating slow-wave structure (SWS). The algorithm is also tested near band edges and for multiple-carriers simulations, both with success.},

We show analytically and with a numerical example that the newly developed reduced model is very close to the Pierce model, especially where the latter is well established. Small deviations do occur at the edges of the amplification band, where Pierce's model is known to lose its accuracy while the reduced model offers a valid physical interpretation.},

This modular configuration has given the possibility of testing on FTU a classical multijunction (MJ) and a passive active multijunction (PAM) that is considered as a privileged candidate for the LH launcher for ITER. The tests have confirmed the good coupling properties of the MJ with plasma densities lower than those normally acceptable for a CG, but at expenses of a reduced power directivity and flexibility in N . The PAM, with a small reduction on power directivity and flexibility in N with reference to the MJ, has shown an efficient coupling when working close to cut-off density (0.8 \texttimes{} 1018 m-3) flush to the first wall, a relatively quiet region in the harsh plasma environment of ITER.

  abstract = {The article begins with a brief review of the achievements of Russian tokamaks in the active period of their development from 1962 to 1973, under the leadership of academician L.A. Artsimovich. During these years, the following basic issues were solved: the equilibrium problem, the MHD stability of the plasma column, and creation of the hot plasma with intense DD neutron radiation. It was shown that the ion confinement in tokamaks is close to the neoclassical model, and the electron confinement is abnormal. It improves with the increasing frequency of collisions, the opposite of the case with ions, in what is known as the alternative model of confinement along the magnetic field. Finally, the first scaling law for the energy lifetime of plasma was obtained, which accurately predicted the plasma parameters of the next generation of tokamaks (the so-called T-4 scaling). The subsequent movement in this direction (the `Artsimovich vector') led to the creation of DT reactors with a fusion power of up to 10 MW (TFTR, JET) and to the ITER project. The main objective of the further development of tokamaks is their transition to steady-state fusion operation, which is a prerequisite for their use in industrial power generation. This makes it necessary to re-evaluate the achievements and obstacles that have to be overcome. The first limitation which thus arises is the so-called PH/S limit, which limits the value of the plasma heating power in a tokamak, as well as the discharge duration {$\increment$}t (the `TRIAM vector') in current tokamaks ({$\increment$}t \textasciitilde{} 1/(PH/S)1.7). Analysis of the existing experimental data shows that the most probable reason for the limitation of PH in existing tokamaks is the breakdown of the plasma sheath in the places of direct contact of the plasma with the wall. The reason for limiting the discharge duration {$\increment$}t may be the gradual accumulation of the erosion products in the contact zones of the plasma with the tokamak first wall, which can facilitate such a breakdown. Creating a closed circulating lithium flow between the first wall and plasma is proposed as the solution to the problem of accumulation of the products of the first wall erosion. Preliminary studies (appendices A and B) have shown that the undesirable accumulation of tritium in the protective lithium films can be avoided if the temperature of the wall of the tokamak discharge chamber does not exceed 400 \textdegree C.},

Multipactor breakdown on dielectric surface is also a major concern for failure of vacuum window in klystrons, cyclotrons and accelerators. Despite of these, the multipactor discharge is not absolutely undesirable. Its usefulness is being explored in electron gun technology, plasma display technology, ICRH antenna conditioning etc. Since multipactor is a pure electron resonance phenomenon, it can happen without any gas being present in the system. Nevertheless, the massive electron bombardment on conductor surfaces removes substantial amount of adsorbed gas species and increases the neutral pressure. In the presence of neutrals these resonant electrons ionize the gaseous atoms and forms the plasma known as multipactor plasma. Many of the high power RF components used in the vacuum transmission line interface sections of ICRH system are having restricted access to surface condition them especially the inner conductors of transmission line sections and dielectric material of vacuum window. By suitably choosing the operating frequency and a minimum pressure, it is possible to form a multipactor plasma in the above components to condition them. Such a conditioning technique is adopted for conditioning of vacuum window and vacuum transmission line of ICRH system. In this paper, an overview of multipactor plasma, a brief description of the test set up, testing conditions and conditioning results are presented.},

The WEST project will primarily offer the key capability of testing for the first time the ITER technology in real plasma environment. In particular, the main divertor (i.e. the lower divertor) of the WEST project will be based on actively cooled tungsten monoblock components and will follow as closely as possible the design and the assembling technology, foreseen for the ITER divertor units. The current design of WEST ITER-like tungsten divertor has now reached a mature stage following the 2013 WEST Final Design Review.

The distinguished author breaks down the topic by first dealing with fusion and then concentrating on the more complex subject of plasma physics. The book begins with the basics of controlled fusion research, followed by discussions on tokamaks, reversed field pinch (RFP), stellarators, and mirrors. The text then explores ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities, resistive instabilities, neoclassical tearing mode, resistive wall mode, the Boltzmann equation, the Vlasov equation, and Landau damping. After covering dielectric tensors of cold and hot plasmas, the author discusses the physical mechanisms of wave heating and noninductive current drive. The book concludes with an examination of the challenging issues of plasma transport by turbulence, such as magnetic fluctuation and zonal flow. Controlled Fusion and Plasma Physics clearly and thoroughly promotes intuitive understanding of the developments of the principal fusion programs and the relevant fundamental and advanced plasma physics associated with each program.},

The choice of this circuit is therefore the most important factor in view to optimize the energy transfer from the power supply to the plasma. Two classical networks, {$\Pi$}- and L-type, are analytically studied in their interaction with the experimental device. From this study, in both cases, numerical values are deduced for the coil inductance, and a capacitance range is determined for the capacitors. An experimental study in argon plasma at pressure range of 40200 mTorr and at 13.56 MHz, performed with the two types of matching networks leads to a much effective energy transfer with the L-type, which must be chosen in order to improve the energetic yield of surface processing (sputtering or etching for instance) with a RF plasma reactor.},

  abstract = {A prototype of ICRF antenna matching system tolerant to fast plasma loading perturbations has been successfully tested at JET. The technique is based on the use of an external (outside the tokamak vacuum vessel) conjugate-T circuit tuned to low resistive impedance by coaxial line-stretchers (trombones). Further impedance transformation, required to complete the entire circuit matching is achieved by a conventional variable stub and trombone tuner. The experimental set-up involved one pair of adjacent straps of the JET A2 antenna array powered by a single RF amplifier. The tests fully confirmed the feasibility of the matching scheme both for vacuum and plasma loading. Clear evidence of high load-tolerance during plasma sawtooth oscillations and Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) was observed in agreement with the circuit simulations. Reliable trip-free performance was demonstrated in the 32\textendash 51MHz frequency band at {$\leq$}1MW power levels. The proposed approach appears as a viable alternative to the in-vessel conjugate-T matching schemes and offers such additional advantages as full compatibility with coaxial transmission line technology, manageable tuning accuracy, separation of launching and matching sub-systems and capability to conjugate remote antenna straps.},

The system allows continuous injection of the radiofrequency (RF) power into plasma in the presence of strong antenna loading perturbations caused by edge-localized modes (ELMs). Reliable ECT performance was demonstrated under a variety of antenna loading conditions including H-mode plasmas with radial outer gaps (ROGs) in the range 4\textendash 14 cm. The high resilience to ELMs predicted during the circuit simulations was fully confirmed experimentally. Dedicated arc-detection techniques and real-time matching algorithms were developed as a part of the ECT project. The new advanced wave amplitude comparison system has proven highly efficient in detection of arcs both between and during ELMs. The ECT system has allowed the delivery of up to 4 MW of RF power without trips into plasmas with type-I ELMs. Together with the 3 dB system and the ITER-like antenna, the ECT has brought the total RF power coupled to ELMy plasma to over 8 MW, considerably enhancing JET research capabilities. This paper provides an overview of the key design features of the ECT system and summarizes the main experimental results achieved so far.},

  abstract = {The paper is dedicated to the characterisation of multi-strap ICRH antenna coupling to plasma. Relevance of traditional concept of coupling resistance to antennas with mutually coupled straps is revised and the importance of antenna port excitation consistency for application of the concept is highlighted. A method of antenna S-matrix measurement in presence of plasma is discussed allowing deeper insight into the problem of antenna-plasma coupling. The method is based entirely on the RF plant hardware and control facilities available at JET and it involves application of variable phasing between the antenna straps during the RF plant operations at\,\,{$>$}100 kW. Unlike traditional techniques relying on low-power (\textasciitilde 10 mW) network analysers, the applied antenna voltage amplitudes are relevant to practical conditions of ICRH operations; crucially, they are high enough to minimise possible effects of antenna loading non-linearity due to the RF sheath effects and other phenomena which could affect low-power measurements. The method has been successfully applied at JET to conventional 4-port ICRH antennas energised at frequencies of 33 MHz, 42 MHz and 51 MHz during L-mode plasma discharges while different gas injection modules (GIMs) were used to maintain comparable plasma densities during the pulses. The S-matrix assessment and its subsequent processing yielding `global' antenna coupling resistances in conditions of equalised port maximum voltages allowed consistent description of antenna coupling to plasma at different strap phasing, operational frequencies and applied GIMs. Comprehensive experimental characterisation of mutually coupled antenna straps in presence of plasma also provided a unique opportunity for in-depth verification of TOPICA computer simulations.},

The method involves measuring the standards through an asymmetrical passive network connected in direct mode and then in reverse mode, and using these measurements to compute the Sparameters of the network. The free parameters of the calibration standards are estimated by minimizing a figure of merit based on the expected equality of the S-parameters of the network when used in direct and reverse modes. The capabilities of the method are demonstrated through simulations, and real measurements are used to estimate the actual offset delay of a 50-{$\Omega$} calibration load that is assigned zero delay by the manufacturer. The estimated delay is 38.8 ps with a 1{$\sigma$} uncertainty of 2.1 ps for this particular load. This result is verified through measurements of a terminated airline. The measurements agree better with theoretical models of the airline when the reference plane is calibrated using the new estimate for the load delay.},

This equation provides a theoretical framework for a global description of the propagation and absorption of lower hybrid waves (or any weakly damped small wavelength mode) in present-day Tokamaks. Resonant toroidal couplings between the unperturbed cylindrical modes are the basic processes involved in this description. They lead to the destruction of correlations above a stochasticity threshold for the toroidal perturbation. A general method for computing the coupling coefficients is proposed and applied under typical current generation conditions. This normal mode energy diffusion provides a simple theory to address the so-called ``spectral gap'' problem.},

Secondly, heating sources on PFCs have been identified highlighting the role of the power from each ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) antenna and LHCD launcher and the interactions between them. A new feedback control algorithm was developed to control the additional power. The real time feedback control of PFC temperatures which makes part of an integrated feedback controller, is a reliable tool routinely used as a basic protection system.

The internal region is further segmented into several blocks, connected to each other via their generalized admittance matrices (GAMs). The latter are calculated by means of either a commercial or a home made tool. The front plate is considered as a whole and analyzed by the moment method, in terms of modes of the slots.

Porous ITER-like deposits are grown to mimic the edge conditions expected in ITER, and a severe degradation in the specular reflectivity is observed as these deposits build up on the mirror surface. In addition, dense oxide films are produced for comparisons with porous films. The composition, morphology and crystal structure of several films were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The cleaning of the deposits and the restoration of the mirrors' optical properties are possible either with a Kaufman source or radio frequency directly applied to the mirror (or radio frequency plasma generated directly around the mirror surface). Accelerating ions of an external plasma source through a direct current applied onto the mirror does not remove deposits composed of oxides.

It considers the methods of maintaining a plasma in equilibrium with the help of a conducting casing, an external maintaining field and the iron core of a transformer. Attention is paid to the role of the inhomogeneity of the maintaining field. It is shown in particular how the shape of the column cross-section depends on the curvature of the lines of force of the maintaining field. For the case (which has practical importance) weak asymmetry of the field distribution in the transverse cross-section, this paper describes a uniform method of consideration, which takes into account the influence of different factors on the equilibrium position of the column. This method is used for calculating plasma equilibrium in a Tokamak model with a conducting casing. Account is here taken of the effect of gaps in the casing and of finite electrical conductivity. Some cases of plasma equilibrium which are outside the standard Tokamak scheme are also considered, such as equilibrium in a conducting shell having the shape of a racetrack, equilibrium where the whole current is transferred by relativistic runaway electrons and equilibrium at high plasma pressure 8j \textasciitilde R/a.},

Self-heating effects are expected to be especially important for control of steady-state plasmas with internal transport barriers (ITBs) and high bootstrap current fractions. Experimental data from ITER will improve strongly the physics basis of projections to Demo of major plasma parameters such as the energy confinement time, beta and density limits, edge pedestal temperature and density, and thermal loads on in-vessel components caused by ELMs and disruptions.

PlasmaPy prioritizes code readability, consistency, and maintainability while using best practices for scientific computing such as version control, continuous integration testing, embedding documentation in code, and code review. We discuss our current and planned capabilities, including features presently under development. The development roadmap includes features such as fluid and particle simulation capabilities, a Grad-Shafranov solver, a dispersion relation solver, atomic data retrieval methods, and tools to analyze simulations and experiments. We describe several ways to contribute to PlasmaPy. PlasmaPy has a code of conduct and is being developed under a BSD license, with a version 0.1 release planned for 2018. The success of PlasmaPy depends on active community involvement, so anyone interested in contributing to this project should contact the authors.

A one-dimensional model, specific to the magnetized ion sheath, is developed and applied to the radiofrequency (RF) sheath which forms near the Faraday screen of an ion cyclotron heating antenna. The RF sheath rectification of the applied voltage is shown to provide a large DC potential drop which can accelerate tons and cause sputtering. Numerical estimates of the high-Z impurity influx are compared with fast wave experiments, and it is concluded that the DC acceleration mechanism is a plausible explanation for the observed high-Z impurity release. Means of controlling the sputtering are examined, including operating with low densities at the Faraday screen.},

Using the apparatus, the dimensions, patterns, and photon emission intensities of the tribomicroplasma were investigated under various reduced air pressures when sliding a diamond hemisphere pin on a sapphire disk. It was found that the shapes and patterns of the two-dimensional plane photon images of the tribomicroplasma vary as a function of the air pressure. Two components of the photon image have been distinguished: (1) a small circular image, the shape and the size of which do not depend on the gas pressure, and (2) a larger image in the shape of a ring with a horseshoe pattern with and without tailing. The size of the second component depends largely on the gas pressure. The first component corresponds to photon emission due to frictional heating, while the second one is the image of the tribomicroplasma generated by the gas discharge. As the air pressure decreases, the image of the tribomicroplasma expands and some parts of the image disappear until the tribomicroplasma image disappears completely at an air pressure of about 10 Pa, leaving only the circular frictional contact image. These characteristics have been explained by a gas discharge theory.},

Depending upon the power level, a range of materials has been used in various systems. The ideal material should have high mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high electrical breakdown voltage, low dielectric loss, favourable dielectric constant and easy joinabillty to metal parts. In order to make a judicious compromise between the material with highly desirable properties and easy availability, sapphire is chosen for the present work. UHV grade joining technique between sapphire and metal has been developed. The dimensions of the dielectric and other components in a pill-box type window design have been optimised using HFSS. The heat transfer and cooling parameters have been optimised using numerical techniques. The design details, fabrication processes and low-power characterisation will be discussed in the paper.},

The conditioning of the device is strongly simplified and short glow discharges are used only on a daily basis. The long term fuel retention was reduced by more than a factor of 5 as demonstrated in gas balance as well as in post mortem analyses. Injecting nitrogen for radiative cooling, discharges with additional heating power up to 23MW have been achieved, providing good confinement (H98y2=1), divertor power loads around 5MWm-2 and divertor temperatures below 10eV. ELM mitigation by pellet ELM pacemaking or magnetic perturbation coils reduces the deposited energy during ELMs, but also keeps the W density at the pedestal low. As a recipe to keep the central W concentration sufficiently low, central (wave) heating is well established and low density H-Modes could be re-established with the newly available ECRH power of up to 4MW. The ICRH induced W sources could be strongly reduced by applying boron coatings to the poloidal guard limiters.},

The materials used were chemical vapor deposition (CVD) SiC and SiC/SiC composites reinforced with either Hi-NicalonTM Type-S, Hi-NicalonTM or SylramicTM fibers fabricated by chemical vapor infiltration. A statistically significant population of flexural samples were irradiated up to 4.6 {$\cdot$} 1025 n/m2 (E {$>$} 0.1 MeV) at 300, 500, and 800 \textdegree C in the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Dimensions and weights of the flexural bars were measured before and after the neutron irradiation. Mechanical properties were evaluated by four point flexural testing. Volume increase was seen for all bend bars following neutron irradiation. The magnitude of swelling depended on irradiation temperature and material, while it was nearly independent of irradiation fluence over the fluence range studied. Flexural strength of CVD SiC increased following irradiation depending on irradiation temperature. Over the temperature range studied, no significant degradation in mechanical properties was seen for composites fabricated with Hi-NicalonTM Type-S, while composites reinforced with Hi-NicalonTM or Sylramic fibers showed significant degradation. The effects of irradiation on the Weibull failure statistics are also presented suggesting a reduction in the Weibull modulus upon irradiation. The cause of this potential reduction is not known.},

  abstract = {An experiment was performed on the TEXTOR tokamak which proves that the plasma can be heated by ion cyclotron resonance using antennas without a Faraday shield. The heating performance of the unshielded antenna was found to be similar to that of a shielded antenna. Although the radiated power was somewhat higher with the unshielded antenna, no impurity problems were encountered. These results are explained on the basis of radiofrequency sheath theory and by the almost perfect shielding of parallel electric fields by the plasma. Implementation criteria for unshielded antennas were obtained.},

  abstract = {After the first demonstration of successful operation with ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) on TEXTOR using an antenna without Faraday shield (FS), a further comparison of an antenna with FS and an antenna without FS has been made over a wide range of plasma conditions (including the improved confinement regime on TEXTOR), in zero phase and ?r phase operation, using various heating scenarios. No restriction in the operational conditions was found to exist for the screenless antenna. A theoretical analysis shows that antenna side limiters are sufficient to protect the antenna conductor from the plasma and that the plasma in front of the antenna can take over the role of the FS without introducing additional losses. The impact of the operation with both antennas on plasma temperature, density, energy, impurities, etc., is discussed in detail. It is found that an antenna pair without shield, but with the antenna feeder area covered, has the same heating efficiency and overall performance as an antenna with FS when ?r phasing is used. In zero phase operation, the antenna with FS performs slightly better. First experiments in which an antenna without shield and without coverage of the antenna feeder area is used are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The technology implications of potential FWCD systems have been assessed at two frequencies of relevance to DEMO as part of a wider study of heating and current drive systems for the EFDA Power Plant Physics and Technology (PPP\&T), based upon two reference DEMO designs. Using the results of Van Eester et al [1], systems studies carried out for a 62MHz mid-harmonic system mounted on a 23MA 5.74T 8.5m major radius DEMO suggested that antenna voltages close to 50kV, and the handling of the resultant sheath power loadings, are likely to be required if all of the 12.9MA non-bootstrap current drive is to be provided by FWCD. The ``wall plug'' electrical efficiency of the midharmonic option of 0.18A/W.m2, potentially rising to 0.23A/W.m2 with the future development of solid state generators, however, looks very attractive, and the coupling is less sensitive to plasma edge parameters than for existing antennas, due to the low k// of 2.8m-1. The design could be based upon that presently under consideration for ITER, except for the replacement of insulating vacuum windows located relatively close to the plasma with all-metal designs [2]. A 352MHz high-harmonic option also looks technologically feasible, using a waveguide-based design and a port plug layout has been provided. This option might bring sheath effect and voltage hold-off benefits, but this is far from proven. In this case, systems studies were not feasible due to a lack of firm results from the physics studies. For both options: (a) the RF generators, power supplies and transmission line components required are either already available, or are under development for ITER, and (b) mechanical and material issues associated with the proposed FWCD antenna structures appear challenging, but will need solving on a wider basis across DEMO.},

Two radically different current distributions on the antenna are considered and their influences on the antenna impedance are studied. These distributions include a one-dimensional (1-D) triangular distribution and a three-dimensional (3-D) exponential current distribution. Balmain analytically solved the first problem. Staras proposed the second one. In this paper, we offer an analytical solution for the second one as proposed by Staras. We compare both distributions and find that impedances resulting from them are remarkably close. We conclude that the impedance of a short antenna, as derived using the quasi-static approximation, is insensitive to the choice of current distribution. Therefore, any of these two theories can be used when analyzing data from an impedance probe immersed in a space plasma.},

  abstract = {Fully non-inductive operation with lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) in the Tore Supra tokamak is achieved using either a fully active multijunction (FAM) launcher or a more recent ITER-relevant passive active multijunction (PAM) launcher, or both launchers simultaneously. While both antennas show comparable experimental efficiencies, the analysis of stability properties in long discharges suggest different current profiles. We present comparative modelling of LHCD with the two different launchers to characterize the effect of the respective antenna spectra on the driven current profile. The interpretative modelling of LHCD is carried out using a chain of codes calculating, respectively, the global discharge evolution (tokamak simulator METIS), the spectrum at the antenna mouth (LH coupling code ALOHA), the LH wave propagation (ray-tracing code C3PO), and the distribution function (3D Fokker\textendash Planck code LUKE). Essential aspects of the fast electron dynamics in time, space and energy are obtained from hard x-ray measurements of fast electron bremsstrahlung emission using a dedicated tomographic system. LHCD simulations are validated by systematic comparisons between these experimental measurements and the reconstructed signal calculated by the code R5X2 from the LUKE electron distribution. An excellent agreement is obtained in the presence of strong Landau damping (found under low density and high-power conditions in Tore Supra) for which the ray-tracing model is valid for modelling the LH wave propagation. Two aspects of the antenna spectra are found to have a significant effect on LHCD. First, the driven current is found to be proportional to the directivity, which depends upon the respective weight of the main positive and main negative lobes and is particularly sensitive to the density in front of the antenna. Second, the position of the main negative lobe in the spectrum is different for the two launchers. As this lobe drives a counter-current, the resulting driven current profile is also different for the FAM and PAM launchers.},

Based on previous conceptual studies and to meet the WEST requirements, a sub-project will implement a new plasma control system (PCS) and a new pulse schedule editor (PSE). The main idea is to use a segment approach to describe the pulse scheduling with a full integration of event handling both on the PCS and on the PSE. After detailed specification work, it has been shown that the real-time framework called DCS (Discharge Control System) which is currently used on ASDEX upgrade fulfills the requirements and could be integrated into the WEST global control infrastructure. For the PSE, the Xedit tool, developed for the future W7X facility, has been chosen. This contribution will begin by a short explanation of the concepts proposed for the control of the plasma and the handling of events during the plasma discharge. Then it will focus on the new centralized architecture of the new Tore Supra PCS and an operating principle example showing the efficiency of the approach to handle normal and off-normal events.

Enhanced plasma potentials {$>$}100 V are observed at locations where local magnetic fields map to active ICRF antennas. In these cases, the enhanced potential appears only when a local plasma density threshold is surpassed\textemdash a threshold that is quantitatively consistent with slow wave (SW) RF rectification theory. However, in many cases large potential enhancements are found in locations that do not map along magnetic field lines to active antennas without obstruction, i.e. locations that are inaccessible to SWs launched by the active antennas. Enhanced potentials in these `unmapped' locations are correlated with local plasma parameters, ICRF electromagnetic fields associated with the fast wave (FW) and SW, launched wave spectra, and the boundary surface geometry. It is found that enhanced plasma potentials in unmapped locations correlate with the FW field strength. These observations are qualitatively consistent with a model that accounts for the conversion of FWs to SWs at conducting surfaces oriented at an oblique angle with respect to the magnetic field, with the SW leading to sheath rectification. In addition, enhanced plasma potentials are found far into the shadow of passive limiter structures. These are correlated with the magnitude of the local FW field strength, yet the effect does not follow any present model. Overall, ICRF-induced plasma potentials may appear in regions far removed from the active antennas, yet due to the complex response of the SOL potentials at a variety of boundary surfaces, it remains unclear what part of the plasma-facing wall should be targeted to mitigate ICRF-induced impurities. The results also suggest that operating active ICRF antennas in a high single pass absorption regime is crucial in minimizing the effects of the FW fields on plasma\textendash material interactions.},

High energy electrons of at least 10 keV were produced in the plasma core by highly directional fast waves in electron-cyclotron-heated plasmas. The ponderomotive potential of the beat wave, produced by fast waves at two different frequencies, was directly measured for the first time by a heavy ion beam probe. Plasma production was demonstrated using the wave fields excited by the combline antenna over a wide range of toroidal magnetic fields (0.5\textasciitilde 2.2 T).},

  abstract = {Ion temperatures of over 100 million degrees need to be reached in future fusion reactors for the deuterium\textendash tritium fusion reaction to work. Ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) is a method that has the capability to directly heat ions to such high temperatures, via a resonant interaction between the plasma ions and radiofrequency waves launched in the plasma. This paper gives an overview of recent developments in this field. In particular a novel and recently developed threeion heating scenario will be highlighted. It is a flexible scheme with the potential to accelerate heavy ions to high energies in high density plasmas as expected for future fusion reactors. New antenna designs will be needed for next step large future devices like DEMO, to deliver steadystate high power levels, cope with fast variations in coupling due to fast changes in the edge density and to reduce the possibility for impurity production. Such a new design is the traveling wave antenna (TWA) consisting of an array of straps distributed around the circumference of the machine, which is intrinsically resilient to edge density variations and has an optimized power coupling to the plasma. The structure of the paper is as follows: to provide the general reader with a basis for a good understanding of the later sections, an overview is given of wave propagation, coupling and RF power absorption in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies, including a brief summary of the traditionally used heating scenarios. A special highlight is the newly developed three-ion scenario together with its promising applications. A next section discusses recent developments to study edge-wave interaction and reduce impurity influx from ICRH: the dedicated devices IShTAR and Aline, field aligned and three-strap antenna concepts. The principles behind and the use of ICRH as an important option for first wall conditioning in devices with a permanent magnetic field is discussed next. The final section presents ongoing developments for antenna systems in next step devices like ITER and DEMO, with as highlight the TWA concept.},

In particular, the underlying coordinate-stretching idea behind PML breaks down in photonic crystals and in other structures where the material is not an analytic function in the direction perpendicular to the boundary, leading to substantial reflections. The alternative is an adiabatic absorber, in which reflections are made negligible by gradually increasing the material absorption at the boundaries, similar to a common strategy to combat discretization reflections in PMLs. We demonstrate the fundamental connection between such reflections and the smoothness of the absorption profile via coupled-mode theory, and show how to obtain higher-order and even exponential vanishing of the reflection with absorber thickness (although further work remains in optimizing the constant factor).},

The dominant variations could be related to changes in the shape of the electron density profiles in the propagating region. In H-mode, the loading resistance decreases as the density at the top of the pedestal is increased, and increases for higher scrape-off-layer (SOL) densities. This dependence on global plasma parameters is generally identical for the three antennas, up to a proportionality constant, while local changes in front of an individual antennas could explain the residual discrepancy. To link the observations with theory, the surface impedance at the Faraday shield was calculated by solving the wave equation in a slab geometry using experimental radial density profiles. This approach leads to a good agreement with measurements over a wide range of operating conditions in L-mode, ELM-free and EDA H-mode plasmas, and it can be interpreted qualitatively in terms of impedance transformation in the SOL region. Implications for more complex modelling approaches are also discussed.},

  abstract = {A steady-state lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) system is under development for advanced tokamak experiments of the Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) device. The KSTAR 5 GHz steady-state LHCD system is being designed to couple an input power of 2 MW for 300 s generated by four 5 GHz klystrons. For the development of this system, there are two critical issues. One is the development of a 5 GHz CW klystron for the RF source of the system. The other is the design of a steadystate LH launcher with active water cooling. In this paper, the current status of the development and design for the KSTAR steady-state LHCD system is described. For the LHCD system, aiming at a basic experimental study of 5 GHz LH wave propagation and operational experience with an LHCD system, the installation of an initial LHCD system with a capacity of 0.5 MW for 2 s is scheduled in 2010 using a 5 GHz prototype klystron and an un-cooled 1 MW launcher. The design and progress for the initial LHCD system are also presented.},

  abstract = {Plug connections usually consist of contacts with built-in spring elements which provide the contact force. When there is a requirement for the transmission of large currents at high current densities copper is used for the current path. Under high mechanical stress copper tends to creep depending on the stress, duration and temperature. This means, that the contact force decreases with time and thus, the contact resistance increases. As soon as the contact force drops below a certain minimum level the connection looses its reliability especially at higher current values. This ageing process is determined by the creep of copper. The process is calculated using a finite element model. For the calculation it is necessary to experimentally determine the relevant creep parameters. Using a contact element as an example it is shown how large the deformation of the copper in the highly stressed regions is and how large the resulting loss in contact force is. The comparison between calculation and measurement is in good agreement.},

The klystron is equipped with a diode type electron gun, a five-cavity RF structure with a highly efficient cooling system for the output cavity, a single tapered waveguide, a single BeO disc RF window, and a large diameter hypervapotron collector. Two breadboard models have been built and tested. At 50\% duty cycle (with 5-ms pulse length), an RF output power of 770 kW has been measured at a beam voltage of 75 kV and a beam current of 22 A. The efficiency is 46.6\% and the gain is 54 dB. On VSWR 1.4, a minimum output power of 660 kW has been obtained and the klystron is stable at all phases. In CW operation, the klystron has produced an output power of 680 kW. The limitation is due to excessive body power. The final prototype with an improved beam optics and thermal design will be ready in the second half of the year 2004.},

In addition to the main characteristics of permanent retention measured during long-discharge operation, this paper discusses the different mechanisms possibly at work in the continuous increase of the in-vessel inventory and describes the morphology and physical properties of the deposits found at several locations in the vacuum chamber. The main results are (1) that D retention mainly depends on the lower hybrid power coupled to the plasma and, to a lesser extent, on the edge temperature and fueling method, (2) that permanent D retention is mainly due to codeposition, and (3) that the hydrogenated carbon deposits present at the surface of the different PFCs are strongly disorganized graphite carbons when they are exposed to high heat fluxes, whose formation occurs through a heterogeneous growth involving both codeposition of nanoparticles and basic structural unit vapor condensates.},

Their lifetimes should be extremely limited due to their proximity to burning plasma, greatly influencing the safe operation of corresponding diagnostics. Repetitive cleaning is expected to provide a solution to the frequent replacement of contaminated FMs, thus prolonging their lifetimes. Three repetitive cleaning cycles using radio frequency plasma were applied to stainless steel (SS) FM samples, to evaluate the change of the mirrors' optical properties and morphology during each cycle. Amorphous carbon films were deposited on mirror surfaces under identical conditions in three cycles. In three cycles with identical cleaning parameters, the total reflectivity was restored at up to 95\%. Nevertheless, with successive cleaning cycles, the FM surfaces gradually appeared to roughen due to damage to the grain boundaries. Correspondingly, the diffuse reflectivity increased from a few percent to 20\% and 27\% after the second and third cycles. After optimizing the cleaning parameters of the second and third cycles, the roughness showed a significant decrease, and simultaneously the increase of diffuse reflectivity was remarkably improved.},

RF rectification has two aspects: current rectification and voltage rectification, and, while the latter is emphasized in many application, we demonstrate the importance of current rectification in analysis of the NSTX divertor during HHFW heating. When rectified currents are accounted for in first-principle models for the heat flux to the tiles, we predict a sizeable enhancement for the heat flux in the presence of an RF field: for one case studied, the predicted heat flux increases from 0.103\,MW/m2 to 0.209\,MW/m2. We also demonstrate how this rectification scales with injected HHFW power by tracking probe characteristics during a HHFW power ramp; the rectified current may be clamped at a certain level. This work is important for minimizing SOL losses of HHFW power in NSTX-U but may also have implications for near-field studies of ICRF antennae: ignoring rectified current may lead to underestimated heat fluxes and overestimated rectified voltages.},

  abstract = {During tokamak operation with lower hybrid (LH) power a few per cent of the launched power is absorbed by the scrape-off layer plasma in magnetic flux tubes in front of the LH grill. At strike points of these flux tubes, intense plasma\textendash wall interaction is seen in visible and infrared wavelengths, and local wall damage can occur. The parallel power flux within these `hot spots' is estimated to be up to about 10 MW m-2 by infrared imagery. Recent experimental results from retarding field analyzer measurements on Tore Supra as well as JET IR camera measurements have shown the existence of fast electrons as far as a few centimeters from the grill mouth. This finding cannot be explained by the standard theory. We present therefore in this paper a novel theory explaining the fast electron generation in a several cm wide layer in front of the LH grill by taking into account LH wave propagation features closely connected with the blob character of edge turbulence. We demonstrate that the computed power-flows then essentially agree with data from infrared diagnostics. An alternative theoretical explanation considers plasma density modulations due to ponderomotive force effects in front of the LH grill.},

Very promising performances have been obtained with the new launcher that is designed to couple up to 4 MW during 1000 s at a power density of 25 MWm-2. The heat load on the guard limiter of the antenna and the fast electron acceleration in the near electric field of the grill mouth remain at a low level, while the mean reflection coefficient never exceeds 10\%. The powerful diagnosis capabilities of the hard x-ray (HXR) fast electron bremsstrahlung tomography has led to significant progresses in the understanding of the LH wave dynamics. The role of the fastest electrons driven by the LH wave is clearly identified. From HXR measurements, an increase of the LH current drive efficiency with the plasma current is predicted and confirmed by a direct determination at zero loop voltage. LH power absorption is observed to be off-axis in almost all plasma conditions, and its radial width clearly depends of antenna phasing conditions. A correlation between the HXR profiles and the onset of an improved core confinement is identified in fully non-inductive discharges. This regime ascribed to some vanishing of the magnetic shear is found to be transient and usually ends when the minimum of the safety factor becomes very close to 2, leading to a large MHD activity.

Its structure is designed for maximum flexibility regarding the choice of coordinate system and dielectric model. The versatility of this code makes it particularly suitable for integrated modeling systems. Using a coordinate system that reflects the nested structure of magnetic flux surfaces in tokamaks, fast and accurate calculations inside the plasma separatrix can be performed using analytical derivatives of a spline-Fourier interpolation of the axisymmetric toroidal MHD equilibrium. Applications to reverse field pinch magnetic configuration are also included. The effects of 3D perturbations of the axisymmetric toroidal MHD equilibrium, due to the discreteness of the magnetic coil system or plasma fluctuations in an original quasi-optical approach, are also studied. Using a Runge\textendash Kutta\textendash Fehlberg method for solving the set of ordinary differential equations, the ray-tracing code is extensively benchmarked against analytical models and other codes for lower hybrid and electron cyclotron waves.},

  abstract = {An assessment of alpha particle confinement is performed in the European DEMO reference design. 3D MHD equilibria with nested flux-surfaces and single magnetic axis are obtained with the VMEC free-boundary code, thereby including the plasma response to the magnetic ripple created by the finite number of TF coils. Populations of fusion alphas that are consistent with the equilibrium profiles are evolved until slowing-down with the VENUS-LEVIS orbit code in the guiding-centre approximation. Fast ion losses through the last-closed flux-surface are numerically evaluated with two ripple models: (1) using the 3D equilibrium and (2) algebraically adding the non-axisymmetric ripple perturbation to the 2D equilibrium. By virtue of the small ripple field and its non-resonant nature, both models quantitatively agree. Differences are however noted in the toroidal location of particles losses on the last-closed flux-surface, which in the first case is 3D and in the second not. Superbanana transport, i.e. ripple-well trapping and separatrix crossing, is expected to be the dominant loss mechanism, the strongest effect on alphas being between 100\textendash 200 KeV. Above this, stochastic ripple diffusion is responsible for a rather weak loss rate, as the stochastisation threshold is observed numerically to be higher than analytic estimates. The level of ripple in the current 18 TF coil design of the European DEMO is not found to be detrimental to fusion alpha confinement.},

  abstract = {A previously reported algorithm for solving the problem of coupling electromagnetic energy in the LHRF froma phased array of identical rectangular waveguides to a plane-stratified, magnetized cold plasma is numerically implemented. The resulting computer codes are sufficiently general to allow for an arbitrary number of waveguides with finite dimensions in both poloidal and toroidal directions and are thus capable of computing coupling to both slow and fast waves in the plasma. Some of the details of the implementation and the extension of the algorithm to allow study of the Fourier spectrum of slow and fast waves launched by the array are discussed. Good agreement is found with previously reported, less general work for the slow wave launching case. The effect of phasing multirow arrays in the poloidal direction is studied, and an asymmetric between phasing 'up' and 'down' is found that persists in the case where the plasma adjacent to the array is uniform. A 4 X 3 array designed to launch fast waves of high phase velocity is studied. By using the optimal poloidal phasing, low reflection coefficients (|R|2 \textsterling 20\%) are found under some not unrealistic edge plasma conditions, but most of the input power is trapped in the outermost layer of the plasma. Implications of our results for fast wave current drive experiments are discussed.},

The equivalent two-port can be characterised by a 2/spl times/2 admittance matrix Y/sub ij/, the off-diagonal elements of which are non-zero due to the reactive coupling between the elements in the antenna array. By connecting another two-port network (a "decoupler") in parallel with the two feedlines, it is possible to reduce the off-diagonal elements of the admittance matrix describing the resulting two-port device to zero, thereby effectively producing a system with no coupling between the two feedlines.

  abstract = {All high power ICRF heating systems include devices for matching the input impedance of the antenna array to the generator output impedance. For most types of antennas used, the input impedance is strongly time-dependent on timescales as rapid as 10\textendash 4 s, while the rf generators used are capable of producing full power only into a stationary load impedance. Hence, the dynamic response of the matching method is of great practical importance. In this paper, world-wide developments in this field over the past decade are reviewed. These techniques may be divided into several classes. The edge plasma parameters that determine the antenna array's input impedance may be controlled to maintain a fixed load impedance. The frequency of the rf source can be feedback controlled to compensate for changes in the edge plasma conditions, or fast variable tuning elements in the transmission line between the generator output and the antenna input connections can provide the necessary time-varying impedance transformation. In ``lossy passive schemes,'' reflected power due to the timevarying impedance of the antenna array is diverted to a dummy load. Each of these techniques can be applied to a pre-existing antenna system. If a new antenna is to be designed, recent advances allow the antenna array to have the intrinsic property of presenting a constant load to the feeding transmission lines despite the varying load seen by each antenna in the array.},

As this effect limits the transmissible RF power and can harm RF systems, it has been widely studied during the last decades. Due to the high cost of experimental tests, simulation tools are heavily used to predict the threshold of multipactor growth. However, their reliability is limited for complex configurations, e.g. when dielectrics or magnetic fields are present. A crucial element of these multipactor simulations is the secondary-emission model. Dionne model is able to model both metals and dielectrics secondary emission but is one-dimension only. As the three-dimensional aspect is essential for complex configurations, the Dionne model is extended do three-dimensions. Measurements of the total electron emission yield have been carried out at the ONERA and shows a good agreement for low-impact energy and low-impact angle electrons, which is relevant in multipactor simulations.},

  abstract = {The coupling of electromagnetic waves in the Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) is an important method to heat magnetically confined plasmas. Changing plasma conditions, which originate from processes like L-mode to H-mode transition or gas puffing, vary the load impedance of the ICRF antennas. To optimize the power transfer from the radio frequency (RF) generators to the antennas and consequently to the plasma, as well as to protect the RF sources against too high reflected power, a system that matches (i.e. transforms) the antenna input impedance to the impedance required by the generator is necessary. At ASDEX Upgrade this matching system consists of two stub tuners for each antenna, which match the antenna impedance for a value preset before the discharge. The length of the stubs cannot be changed fast enough to compensate plasma variations even on the moderate timescale of the confinement time in ASDEX Upgrade. The use of 3dB-couplers allows operation even with varying load, at the cost of a reduced power to the plasma.},

  abstract = {The design of the multijunction grill to be used in current drive experiments calls for the optimization of three important parameters: the phase shift A{$<$}j{$>$} between adjacent waveguides, the length of the multijunction grill Lg (from the junction to the mouth) and the surface density OQ. This has been demonstrated both analytically and numerically by the results obtained for the four-waveguide grill designed for a small tokamak. It has been shown that the current drive efficiency (or the directivity) can reach 50\% for practically arbitrary A{$<$}f{$>$} (?* 0\textdegree, 180\textdegree ), if Lg is properly chosen. The enhanced current drive efficiency at A * 90\textdegree{} follows from an uneven power distribution among the separate waveguides and from the self-adaptive adjustment of the phases of the incident waves. The risk of power overloading of the waveguides increases with decreasing OQ. A short description of the author's variant of the theory of wave diffraction on the junction is also given. Good agreement between the simple analytic model and the numerical solutions is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Lower hybrid (LH) waves are very important for heating and current drive in tokamaks. Phased arrays of rectangular waveguides, generally called grills, are typically used as launchers. We develop a code which solves, in the 3D geometry of the grill structure, the problem of efficient coupling: the power density spectrum of the emitted waves, the power reflection coefficient, the power lost by the waves launched in the inaccessible region and the directivity of the waves transmitted into the accessible region. The code is also able to determine the 3D electric field in front of the grill. An efficient adaptive full wave solver is used to determine the wave propagation in a 1D plasma slab geometry. To evaluate the very large number of 2D k-space infinite integrals for the coupling elements, we have developed a method based on high order Gaussian quadratures combined with 2D B-splines in the accessible region for the plasma related part of the integrands. This method is well suited to handle large structures and many modes because the computational time is only weakly dependent on the size of the problem. An iterative evaluation of the integrands in the inaccessible region is adopted to handle the presently overlooked near singular behaviour of the integrands as well as the spectral power density associated with the eigenmodes. The role of collisions is clarified in this context.},

The extended code is still computationally fast because of the use of (i) 2D splines of the plasma surface admittance in the accessibility region of the k-space, (ii) high order Gaussian quadrature rules for the integration of the coupling elements and (iii) utilizing the symmetries of the coupling elements in the multiperiodic structures. The extended OLGA code is benchmarked against the ALOHA-1D, ALOHA-2D and TOPLHA codes for the coupling of the C3 and C4 TORE SUPRA launchers for several plasma configurations derived from reflectometry and interferometery. Unlike nearly all codes (except the ALOHA-1D code), OLGA does not require large computational resources and can be used for everyday usage in planning experimental runs.

  abstract = {A new concept of lower hybrid antenna for current drive has been proposed for ITER (Bibet et al 1995 Nucl. Fusion 35 1213\textendash 23): the passive active multijunction (PAM) antenna that relies on a periodic combination of active and passive waveguides. An actively cooled PAM antenna at 3.7 GHz has recently been installed on the tokamak Tore Supra. This paper summarizes the comprehensive experimental characterization of the coupling properties of the PAM antenna to the Tore Supra plasmas. In this paper, the electromagnetic properties of the antenna are measured at a reduced power ({$<$}1 MW) to allow a systematic comparison with linear wave coupling theory and the associated modelling based on the linear ALOHA code. In a wide range of edge electron densities at the antenna aperture (spanning a factor 20 from 0.5 \texttimes{} nc to 10 \texttimes{} nc where nc is the slow wave density cut-off, nc = 1.7 \texttimes{} 1017 m-3 at 3.7 GHz) and antenna phasing, the ALOHA simulations reproduce the experimental results observed on Tore Supra. In addition, reduced power reflection coefficients ({$<$}5\%) are measured at a low edge density, close to nc, i.e. in the range 0.5\textendash 3 \texttimes{} nc. Measurement and analysis with ALOHA of the antenna\textendash plasma scattering matrices provide explanation of the good coupling properties of the PAM antenna close to nc by highlighting the crucial role of the slow wave intercoupling between active and passive waveguides through the plasma edge. This detailed validation of the coupling modelling is an important step towards the validation of the PAM concept in view of further optimizing the electromagnetic properties of the future ITER antenna.},

  abstract = {To achieve steady-state operation on future fusion devices, in particular on ITER, the coupling of the lower hybrid wave must be optimized on a wide range of edge conditions. However, under some specific conditions, deleterious effects on the lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) coupling are sometimes observed on Tore Supra. In this way, dedicated LHCD experiments have been performed using the LHCD system of Tore Supra, composed of two different conceptual designs of launcher: the fully active multi-junction (FAM) and the new passive active multijunction (PAM) antennas. A non-linear interaction between the electron density and the electric field has been characterized in a thin plasma layer in front of the two LHCD antennas. The resulting dependence of the power reflection coefficient (RC) with the LHCD power is not predicted by the standard linear theory of the LH wave coupling. A theoretical model is suggested to describe the non-linear wave\textendash plasma interaction induced by the ponderomotive effect and implemented in a new full wave LHCD code, PICCOLO-2D (ponderomotive effect in a coupling code of lower hybrid wave-2D). The code self-consistently treats the wave propagation in the antenna vicinity and its interaction with the local edge plasma density. The simulation reproduces very well the occurrence of a non-linear behaviour in the coupling observed in the LHCD experiments. The important differences and trends between the FAM and the PAM antennas, especially a larger increase in RC for the FAM, are also reproduced by the PICCOLO-2D simulation. The working hypothesis of the contribution of the ponderomotive effect in the non-linear observations of LHCD coupling is therefore validated through this comprehensive modelling for the first time on the FAM and PAM antennas on Tore Supra.},

In this paper, these results are extended to the slow-wave case when nz{$>$} the refractive index in the static magnetic field direction, exceeds unity. It is found that the plasma is indeed accessible to the slow waves if Golant's accessibility criterion n z {$>$} 1 + ( w /w )2 is satisfied. The following recommendations can be made for coupling r.f. energy to the lower-hybrid resonance: (i) if w D e / w c e \textasciitilde{} 0 - 4 . efficient coupling is possible by launching TEM-like waves on the plasma column, (ii) if w /w S 0.4 and if the transverse machine dimensions exceed the r.f. vacuum wavelength, it is possible to couple TM waves using passive slow-wave structures inside the machine walls, (iii) if w p e / o ; c e 2 ; 0.4, but for smaller machine dimensions, recourse must be taken to transverseelectric slow-wave coupling with current-carrying coils of appropriate periodicity. If, as was pointed out by Glagolev, propagation from the plasma edge to the hybrid layer is not materially affected by the inclusion of finite-temperature effects, by far the most elegant solution (with potential application to thermonuclear plasmas) for coupling r.f. energy from the second to the twentieth ion-cyclotron harmonic waves is by launching TEM-like waves in the coaxial waveguide formed by the plasma columnand the containing walls.},

  abstract = {For the central heating of a fusion reactor ion cyclotron radio frequency heating (ICRH) is the first choice method as it is able to couple RF power to the ions without density limit. The drawback of this heating method is the problem of excitation of the magneto-sonic wave through the plasma boundary layer from the antenna located along the wall, without exceeding its voltage standoff. The amount of coupling depends on the antenna excitation and the surface admittance at the antenna output due to the plasma profile. The paper deals with the optimization of the antenna excitation by the use of sections of traveling-wave antennas (TWAs) distributed all along the reactor wall between the blanket modules. They are mounted and fed in resonant ring system(s). First, the physics of the coupling of a strap array is studied by simple models and the coupling code ANTITER II. Then, after the study of the basic properties of a TWA section, its feeding problem is solved by hybrids driving them in resonant ring circuit(s). The complete modeling is obtained from the matrices of the TWA sections connected to one of the feeding hybrid(s). The solution is iterated with the coupling code to determine the loading for a reference low-coupling ITER plasma profile. The resulting wave pattern up to the plasma bulk is derived. The proposed system is totally load resilient and allows us to obtain a very selective exciting wave spectrum. A discussion of some practical implementation problems is added.},

A test on WEST would provide a proof of principle of the validity of the TWA approach together with a comparison with the existing WEST IC antennas. The chosen geometry of the TWA section is compatible with one unit of the complete set designed for a future reactor.},

  abstract = {Travelling Wave Array (TWA) antennas distributed along the periphery of the tokamak are presently considered as Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequencies (ICRF) heating solution for the DEMO reactor. Compared to the conventional ICRF antenna systems currently in use or designed for future machines like ITER, the TWA consists of antenna sections integrated in the breeding blanket scattered around the machine, each one fed through a variable coupler in a resonant ring configuration. Previous modelling of an antenna system for DEMO with 16 quadruple TWA sections of 8 straps shows that a power capability exceeding 50 MW can be obtained in the frequency band of interest using the reference low coupling plasma profile of ITER. The described system optimizes the coupling to the plasma by providing a large number of radiating elements, which results in enhanced antenna directivity hereby decreasing the antenna power density. This results in a maximum strap voltage amplitude of only 15 kV and maximum inter-strap voltage amplitude of 18 kV. The generators remain matched for all loading conditions: the system is totally load resilient. Following the recommendation of the work package heating and current drive (WPHCD) Review Panel, a TWA ICRH system consisting in fewer sections concentrated in front of the equatorial ports is analysed in this paper and compared to the previous design. Reducing the number of sections increases the power density and its associated voltages. To couple 50 MW on the ITER density profile, voltages up to 30 kV are now required. Some aspects like the coupling between sections and its repercussion on the feeding network are briefly discussed. To assess the feasibility of the TWA fed by a resonant ring as ICRH system for a DEMO reactor, a test on an existing medium size tokamak is under study.},

Manufacture and assembly cost was minimised by using a modular interconnect design, with common components shared among different design variants.

Each bellows is shielded by slender copper-beryllium fingers working as pre-loaded beams in order to provide a constant force at the sliding contact. Unless the sliding friction and some geometrical parameters of the fingers are kept within a limited range, a large irreversible lateral deflection towards the vacuum chamber axis may occur and eventually block the beam aperture. The finite element analysis presented here simulates this failure mechanism, providing a complete understanding of the finger behaviour as well as the influence of the various design parameters. An implicit non-linear two-dimensional model integrating friction on the sliding contacts, geometrical non-linearity and plasticity was implemented in a first stage. The design was then verified through the whole working range using an explicit formulation, which overcame the instabilities resulting from the sudden release of internal energy stored in the finger.},

The power and temperature dependences of the absorption in the near field of the LH grill were investigated with a series of simulations.

The bright spots are clearly related to the lower hybrid power as they disappear when the lower hybrid power is switched off. According to the analysis versus various parameters, the brightness of the spots clearly decreases with increasing plasma\textendash wall distance, i.e. the distance between the last closed flux surface and the poloidal limiter.

It was started in 2013 and consists in transforming the Tore Supra tokamak into an X point divertor device, while taking advantage of its long discharge capability. To operate the next coming operations of WEST, new controllers are required. These developments are an opportunity to develop a new Plasma Control System (PCS) architecture featuring build-in real time handling of both plasma and plants events, thus addressing key ITER needs. The Tore Supra PCS will be refurbished including a new Pulse Schedule Editor (PSE). The main idea is to use a time segmented approach to describe the pulse schedule with a full integration of event handling both on PCS and PSE. Further to detailed requirement specifications and architecture design, two software tools were selected to define and execute a whole plasma discharge defined as a set of time segments. The PCS real-time framework (RTF) is based on an upgraded version of the AUG framework, called DCS (Discharge Control System). The PSE is the Xedit application used on WEGA and under further development for W7-X facility. This paper reports on the status of the new WEST PCS developments. The on-going developments to adapt DCS to the Tore Supra Control infrastructure networks (new real-time network, chronology system and pulse supervision) will be reported. The required preparations for the use of Xedit will be presented, mainly the appropriate formal description of the WEST control system and the implementation of the mapping between the Xedit experiment configuration and DCS configuration files.},

In FAST (Fusion Advanced Studies Torus), a compact tokamak with high toroidal magnetic field (8.5 T) and plasma current (up to 8 MA), the design foresees an ICRH system able to couple a RF power up to 30 MW through six antennas, in the 60 \textendash{} 90 MHz frequency range. FAST is a new tokamak machine proposed as a Satellite Tokamak for accompanying the International Thermonuclear Experimental Torus (ITER) programme. Each antenna consists of eight straps arranged in a four rows by two columns array. Many of the RF characteristics of the antenna can be simulated with a good accuracy, using a commercial code as HFSS, by replacing the magnetized plasma with a high permittivity dielectric. Salty water solution can advantageously be used as dummy load. All the relevant parameters of the antenna have been carefully evaluated in a large range of straps' loading by varying the distance between straps and dummy load. For a given maximum voltage sustainable in the line without arcing or breakdown, the power handling capability of the RF system and the improvements in the minimum conductivity (gmin) of the antenna array, produced by inserting in each transmission line a service stub, used for a cooling issue, have been studied. The effects of asymmetries between central and side straps and the impact of the presence of the Faraday Shield (FS) is also investigated. Finally the resilience to the loading variation of a conventional matching unit, made by shifter and stub, is compared to a load tolerant matching based on the Conjugate-T concept.},

  abstract = {This experimental and theoretical study examines the excitation of a plasma antenna using an argon surface wave discharge operating at 500 MHz with RF power levels up to 120 W and gas pressures between 0.03 and 0.5 mb. The results show that the length of the plasma column increases as the square root of the applied power and that the plasma density decreases linearly from the wave launcher to the end of the plasma column. These results are consistent with a simple global model of the antenna. Since noise is critical to communication systems, the noise generated by the plasma was measured from 10 to 250 MHz. Between 50 and 250 MHz the excess noise temperature was found to be 17.2 1.0 dB above 290 K. This corresponds to an ohmic thermal noise source at 1.4 0.3 eV, compared with an electron temperature of 1.65 eV predicted by the global model. Estimates of the electrical conductivity of the plasma column based on measured electron number densities lead to an antenna efficiency of about 65\% at a transmission frequency of 100 MHz and an increase in total antenna noise of 1 dB due to the plasma. Theoretical modeling and experimental observations of the radiation pattern of the antenna show that the linear variation of conductivity and finite resistance of the column lead to a reduction in the depth of the nulls in the radiation pattern and a consequent increase in the width of the main lobe.},

This abnormality was reported by Bui and Gagne but discounted by them as being mathematically spurious. By contrast, in this paper an exact theory has been used and the abnormality is shown to be genuine, and due to the hybrid mode redistribution of fields.},

  abstract = {Almost all optical diagnostic systems in ITER will require the implementation of mirror recovery and protection systems. Plasma cleaning is considered to be the most promising technique for the removal of metal deposits from optical surfaces. The engineering and physical aspects of RF discharge application for continuous or periodic plasma treatment are discussed with a focus on implementation under ITER conditions. The ion flux parameters obtained in capacitively coupled (CC) RF discharge were measured in the mock-up of a plasma cleaning system. The uniformity of sputtering in CC RF discharge with and without a magnetic field was studied experimentally for the cylindrical discharge reactor geometry and compared with numerical simulations. The sharp increase in the sputtering rate resulting from the non-uniform radial distribution of the ion flux was observed near the electrode edges. The longitudinal magnetic field improves sputtering uniformity. It was demonstrated that Al/Al2O3 deposits can be removed in the Ne and D2 plasma of CC RF discharge but longterm exposition results in the degradation of the polycrystalline molybdenum mirror surface. The efficiency of Al sputtering in the atmosphere containing O2 and N2 fractions was studied in the D2/O2 and D2/N2 plasma of glow discharge. The addition of 2\% of oxygen or nitrogen increases the sputtering yield by 3\textendash 4 times as compared with that in a nominally pure D2 discharge. The impact of metal deposits on the performance of diagnostic mirrors is discussed. It was shown that an ultrathin metallic film with a thickness as low as a few nm may cause a significant degradation of diagnostic mirrors with a transparent coating.},

The design of this antenna, called PAM (Passive Active Multijunction), developed in cooperation with the EURATOM-CEA association since several years, fulfils the following requests. 1) It can operate in the full shadow of the vessel port to avoid damage from the large particle flow inside the scrape-off layer (SOL) plasma. 2) It can tolerate the heating due to the perpendicular energy and neutron fluxes; 3) It preserves a level of power handling and current drive (CD) efficiency acceptable for ITER. Points 1 and 3 imply solving the problem of good power coupling to the main plasma in conditions of almost vanishing plasma in front of the grill. The proposal was to locate cooling ducts in between the LH fed waveguides in the final part of the launcher, except at the front end, where the usual periodicity of a multijunction (MJ) is restored by interposing passive waveguides between the active ones [1]. In this way the N| | spectrum (N| | is the parallel index of refraction) and hence the CD performances can be made similar to a usual MJ, provided a strong cross coupling exists between the active and passive waveguides. This in turn occurs if the plasma density in front},

  abstract = {Active current drive with lower hybrid (LH) waves in the advanced scenario plasmas at JET-EFDA was successful after a systematic study of the coupling problems that derive from the H-mode features of the edge plasma, namely very low density and ELM activity. The LH coupling has been improved compared to the past, by making the edge plasma in front of the LH launcher denser and more uniform. Injecting deuterated methane (CD4) from a nearby gas pipe increases the density in front of the LH launcher at least by a factor of 1.5, above the cut-off value for the LH frequency. A better matching of the plasma shape to that of the LH antenna makes the plasma ahead of the LH launcher more regular along the poloidal angle. These two techniques together have permitted a balanced supply of the three LH grills, with an average reflection below 4\%, as in the previous L-mode operation. CD4 does not affect the performances nor does it contaminate the main plasma up to the maximum flow rate so far used, CD4 {$>$} 1022 el s-1 and now it is routinely applied in JET (up to 4 MW have been injected for longer than 8 s) with very encouraging results for LHCD. Even though CD4 is not suitable for ITER for tritium retention, the possibility of controlling locally and safely the scrape-off plasma density has been demonstrated.},

The power routinely and safely managed for the maximum time allowed by the LH power plant (0.9 s) without any fault in the transmission lines is 250 kW, corresponding to 75 MW m-2 across the antenna active area and very close to the design value of 270 kW or 80 MW m-2. The achieved value is at least 1.4 times larger than the ITER request, which would be only 52 MW m-2, if the 33 MW m-2 required to the ITER grill in order to couple 20 MW to the plasma, are scaled up linearly with f , from fITER = 5 GHz. This linear scaling of the power handling capability of the LH antennae is indeed conservative with respect to the available data. The test results validate also the other two main expectations relevant to ITER, foreseen by the codes, namely to operate with the grill entirely in the vessel shadow and to still preserve good current drive (CD) efficiency. Even with the grill mouth retracted 2 mm inside the port shadow and with density in front of the launcher very close or even lower than the cut-off value, the PAM reflection coefficient is always 2.5\%, if the antenna has been properly conditioned. The CD efficiency is comparable to that of a conventional grill, once the lower directivity is taken into account. Flexibility in determining the N|| spectrum is also maintained, according to hard x-rays and electron cyclotron emission spectra. Conditioning the PAM in order to operate at the ITER equivalent power level required only one day of radio-frequency operation, without a previous baking of the waveguides.},

The results are expressed in terms of quantities routinely measured in most experiments so that scaling with different plasma parameters can readily be seen. Prad is strongly dependent on electron density and temperature in coronal equilibrium (i.e. Prad {$\sim$} with {$\delta$} {$\cong$} 2.0 and {$\gamma$} between 0.5 and 1.5). The strong anomalous diffusion in many plasmas can, however, considerably reduce these dependences ({$\delta$} as low as 0.8 and {$\gamma$} between -0.1 and 0.9). Prad can be less than the coronal equilibrium value, but usually it is larger by as much as two orders of magnitude, depending on the diffusion coefficient. A criterion has been developed for the applicability of coronal equilibrium to calculate Prad. Also, expression of the calculations in a simplified form has indicated an accuracy of about a factor of two when applied to more than a hundred experimental plasmas. These results show Prad is often a dominant loss mechanism and can, therefore, lead to considerable modification of existing scaling laws.},

The scattering parameters of an port cannot be measured directly with a two-port VNA if 2. Only the scattering parameters of all two-port combinations of the device-under-test (DUT) are measurable. Thereby, the measured two-port scattering parameters strongly depend on the external terminations of the DUTs ports, which are not connected to the VNA during the measurements. In order to eliminate the influences of these external possibly reflective terminations, an error correction has to be performed. In comparison to known correction methods, the multiport method has some advantages. Firstly, the external terminations can be chosen arbitrarily, i.e., short and open circuits are realizable as long as the topology of the DUT allows it. Secondly, the terminations, except for one, can be unknown, leading to a reduction of the inconsistency problem caused by erroneous data of the external terminations, which is also known from the calibration of VNAs with completely known calibration standards. The good performance of the multiport method is shown by measured results.},

  abstract = {A theoretical model for the investigation of the ICRF fundamental minority plasma heating scheme in tokamak configurations is developed. The wave differential operator is obtained by including in a selfconsistent manner the effects of strong wave damping, linear mode conversion and a one-dimensional non-uniform equilibrium configuration. It is found that the use of a self-consistent equilibrium distribution function yields important modifications of the ICRF wave differential operator applicable to this heating regime. In particular, the paper presents a set of new terms which are resonant at the fundamental cyclotron frequency and which ensure the self-adjointness of the resulting wave operator in the limit k{$\Vert$} \textrightarrow{} 0. A numerical scheme is developed with which solutions for the ICRF electromagnetic field and the corresponding power deposition and energy flux profiles can be obtained. An extensive parametric study is carried out for a range of wave and plasma parameters illustrative of current and proposed JET operating regimes. The results are considerably different from those obtained using a WKB fast wave model. In particular, the `full wave' model presented in this paper yields a percentage for the wave power absorbed by the ionic species which is much larger than the one predicted by the WKB theory. The model presented also shows that the majority species can absorb a much higher proportion of the incident wave power than previously reported. Finally, the results obtained for JET indicate that in the case of low magnetic field incidence a sizeable percentage of the launched wave energy can be reflected on the fast wave branch for values of k{$\Vert$} {$\leq$} 6 m-1 and that at higher plasma temperatures electron heating becomes appreciable.},

  abstract = {Multipactor is an electron resonance phenomenon which occurs at radio frequencies in components and transmission lines operating in vacuum. Multipactor represents a possible payload failure mechanism for communications satellites since it can destroy RF components or transmission lines, or it can significantly raise noise levels. The Telstar 4 series of spacecraft presently being built for AT\&T by Martin Marietta will carry 24 high-power transponders for Ku-band (/spl sim/60 W/transponder) and 24 medium-power transponders for C-band (/spl sim/25 W/transponder). The outputs of a number of transponders are frequency multiplexed prior to being input to the Ku-band or C-band antenna feed networks (AFN). Computation shows that instantaneous peak powers due to the combined signals can reach 4500 W at Ku-band and 3900 W at C-band. For the purpose of ensuring that the AFN would not suffer multipactor breakdown in orbit, each of the individual components in the C-band and Ku-band AFN were subjected to instantaneous peak powers well in excess of that which will be experienced in space. The high instantaneous peak powers required for this pre-flight testing were realized by phasor addition of the high-VSWR standing waves of two diplexed carriers of slightly different frequencies. This technique effectively provided an instantaneous peak power 32 times the average power output of each of the two input carriers. Test sets to accomplish this were constructed at both C-band and Ku-band. The ability to detect multipactor (by two independent means) was assured by measuring test cells which were specifically designed to break down for the test levels previously mentioned. Investigations of the separate AFN components for the Telstar 4 spacecraft showed that all components passed with substantial margin.{$<>$}},

This paper presents a novel and highly improved formulation of scattering matrices that is consistent with convention, more efficient to implement, and more versatile than what has been otherwise presented in the literature. Semi-analytical methods represent a device as a stack of layers that are uniform in the longitudinal direction. Scattering matrices are calculated for each layer and are combined into a single overall scattering matrix that describes propagation through the entire device. Free space gaps with zero thickness are inserted between the layers and the scattering matrices are made to relate fields which exist outside of the layers, but directly on their boundaries. This framework produces symmetric scattering matrices so only two parameters need to be calculated and stored instead of four. It also enables the scattering matrices to be arbitrarily interchanged and reused to describe longitudinally periodic devices more efficiently. Numerical results are presented that show speed and efficiency can be increased by more than an order of magnitude using the improved formulation.},

This paper presents the principle and the experimental setup of these diagnostics, with chosen results illustrating their capabilities to determine the spatial structure of the turbulence and to assess the link between energy transport and fluctuations. These flexible and complementary measurements made it possible to analyze the confinement and fluctuation scaling laws with nondimensional parameters, which requires a wide variety of plasma conditions.},

This flashover threshold depends on the dielectric materials; a sapphire with F-center defects shows a lower threshold. For further investigations of the flashover mechanism under an rf field, in situ measurements of the charges built up on the surface both before and after flashover and high-speed photography observations of the flashover avalanches have been made. The results indicate an electron accumulation; its relaxation leaves positive charges on the surface. The relaxation time is found to be {$<$} 40 ns.

From the results of a high-power examination of rf windows with several kinds of alumina ceramic, it was found that alumina with a crystallized grain boundary and without any voids between the boundaries, thus having a low loss tangent value, is not liable for F centers, even under multipactoring. Flashover in a tree-like pattern of alumina luminescence occasionally takes place on a TiN-coated surface where multipactoring is suppressed.

The FAIT antennas demonstrated higher loading resistance and lower temperature on ceramic feed-through than HAS antennas. Antenna impedance and injected power were measured precisely using a directional coupler installed between the impedance matching device and antenna. It was shown that an injection power of 1.8 MW or a power density of 15 MW/m2 would be possible for short-pulse discharges. The mutual coupling between two FAIT antennas is small enough, since any current phase is possible without adjusting the impedance matching device.

The code allows one to simulate all stages of the multipactor discharge, from the onset of the electron avalanche to saturation. It is shown that the threshold for the excitation of a single-surface multipactor on a dielectric placed in a low-profile waveguide with absorbing walls increases as compared to that in the case of an unbounded dielectric surface due to escape of electrons onto the waveguide walls. It is found that, depending on the microwave field amplitude and the SEE characteristics of the waveguide walls, the multipactor may operate in two modes. In the first mode, which takes place at relatively low microwave amplitudes, a single-surface multipactor develops only on the dielectric, the surface of which acquires a positively potential with respect to the waveguide walls. In the second mode, which occurs at sufficiently high microwave intensities, a single-surface multipactor on the dielectric and a two-surface multipactor between the waveguide walls operate simultaneously. In this case, both the dielectric surface and the interwall space acquire a negative potential. It is shown that electron scattering from the dielectric surface and waveguide walls results in the appearance of high-energy tails in the electron distribution function.},

  abstract = {The superconducting tokamak Tore Supra was built in the 1980s, when the Joint European Torus (JET) started operation, with the aim of addressing technological and scientific questions relevant to long-pulse operation, in complement to JET objectives. The past 20 years of operation have confirmed that it was essential to integrate within a single device the features of high-performance long pulses in order to progress on the technological side with the level of effort needed for integration and interface management. Besides the 20 years of successful operation of the superconducting magnet, successive developments of the actively cooled plasma-facing components have allowed us to increase progressively the level of performance of Tore Supra. Since 2001, Tore Supra has been operated with an actively cooled toroidal pump limiter, complemented by actively cooled antenna protections and wall protection [Composants Internes et Limiteur (CIEL) project], capable of removing up to 20 to 25 MW of power. The high-performance long-pulse capability of Tore Supra culminated in 2003 with record discharge durations of 6 min driven by lower hybrid current drive (LHCD). Although Tore Supra has a circular cross section, which departs from the favorite divertor edge configuration, it has been possible to address original physics questions that are of importance for current and future scientific choices of ITER and beyond, e.g., plasma discharges driven by LHCD or ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) (no neutral beams), carbon wall environment at constant temperature, ergodic edge, pellet/supersonic gas injection, electron cyclotron resonance heating\textendash assisted mode control or plasma breakdown, etc. The large heat exhaust margin available with the CIEL components has made possible the current installation of a new LHCD power system with 16 upgraded 700-kW klystrons and an actively cooled passive/active lower hybrid antenna, which opens the prospects for larger-density operation and larger ICRH coupling and therefore higher-performance plasmas (higher bootstrap fraction) over discharges of the same or longer duration. This paper briefly sketches the research reported in this special issue of Fusion Science and Technology dedicated to the Tore Supra tokamak. It briefly sketches its history, describes its mission, and outlines its physics and technology results.},

  abstract = {Tore Supra routinely addresses the physics and technology of very long-duration plasma discharges, thus bringing precious information on critical issues of long pulse operation of ITER. A new ITER relevant lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) launcher has allowed coupling to the plasma a power level of 2.7 MW for 78 s, corresponding to a power density close to the design value foreseen for an ITER LHCD system. In accordance with the expectations, long distance (10 cm) power coupling has been obtained. Successive stationary states of the plasma current profile have been controlled in real-time featuring (i) control of sawteeth with varying plasma parameters, (ii) obtaining and sustaining a `hot core' plasma regime, (iii) recovery from a voluntarily triggered deleterious magnetohydrodynamic regime. The scrape-off layer (SOL) parameters and power deposition have been documented during L-mode rampup phase, a crucial point for ITER before the X-point formation. Disruption mitigation studies have been conducted with massive gas injection, evidencing the difference between He and Ar and the possible role of the q = 2 surface in limiting the gas penetration. ICRF assisted wall conditioning in the presence of magnetic field has been investigated, culminating in the demonstration that this conditioning scheme allows one to recover normal operation after disruptions. The effect of the magnetic field ripple on the intrinsic plasma rotation has been studied, showing the competition between turbulent transport processes and ripple toroidal friction. During dedicated dimensionless experiments, the effect of varying the collisionality on turbulence wavenumber spectra has been documented, giving new insight into the turbulence mechanism. Turbulence measurements have also allowed quantitatively comparing experimental results with predictions by 5D gyrokinetic codes: numerical results simultaneously match the magnitude of effective heat diffusivity, rms values of density fluctuations and wavenumber spectra. A clear correlation between electron temperature gradient and impurity transport in the very core of the plasma has been observed, strongly suggesting the existence of a threshold above which transport is dominated by turbulent electron modes. Dynamics of edge turbulent fluctuations has been studied by correlating data from fast imaging cameras and Langmuir probes, yielding a coherent picture of transport processes involved in the SOL.},

  abstract = {A simple and comprehensive method is derived and used to quantify the impact of scaling laws on tokamak reactor dimensioning. Assuming prescribed geometrical coefficients, we find the ensemble of possible triplets R, B and normalized beta which allow one to reach target fusion gain Q and fusion power , at an arbitrary Greenwald fraction. The model is generic and derived for any scaling law of the energy confinement time. Using the IPB98(y,2) scaling law (ITER Physics Expert Group on Confinement and Transport and Confinement Modeling and Database and ITER Physics Basis Editors 1999 Nucl. Fusion 39 2175) leads to ITER specifications, as expected. The recently proposed new scaling law for H-mode plasmas (DS03, (Sips et al 2018 Nucl. Fusion 58 126010)) is shown to lead to modest changes to the dimensioning, except for B which could be significantly smaller for the same target performance. The impact on the dimensioning of critical exponents of the scaling law\textemdash both regarding engineer and dimensionless variables\textemdash is assessed, pushing for their determination with refined accuracy. Finally, the method is applied to a DEMO-like machine. The DS03 scaling law is found to have favorable consequences on the dimensioning as compared to IPB98(y,2), provided one is able to operate at larger , which can reveal challenging in a reactor aiming at zero disruption. Importantly, the opposite scaling of both scaling laws with respect to the aspect ratio are shown to have significant consequences on the optimal choice of this critical parameter.},

In this work, statistical properties of various aspects of breakdown, such as the number of pulses between breakdowns, breakdown locations and crater sizes are studied independently with almost identical pulsed dc systems at the University of Helsinki and in CERN. In high-gradient experiments, copper electrodes with parallel plate capacitor geometry, undergo thousands of breakdowns. The results support the classification of the events into primary and secondary breakdowns, based on the distance and number of pulses between two breakdowns. Primary events follow a power law on the log\textendash log scale with the slope {$\alpha\approx$}1.30, while the secondaries are highly dependent on the pulsing parameters.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the conventionally used S-parameters are not suitable for characterizing antennas, particularly relating their radiation efficiency with the input scattering parameters. In particular, the classical S-parameters do not work when the load is conjugately matched as it produces nonphysical artifacts. These artifacts are not real and do not exist when a different form of the S-parameters are used. Thus, the first objective of this paper is to introduce the two different types of S-parameters generally used to characterize microwave circuits with lossy characteristic impedance. The first one is called the pseudo wave, an extension of the conventional travelling wave concepts, and is useful when it is necessary to discuss the properties of a microwave network junction irrespective of the impedances connected to the terminals. However, one has to be extremely careful in providing a physical interpretation of the mathematical expressions as in this case the reflection coefficient can be greater than one, even for a passive load impedance with a conjugately matched transmission line. Also, the power balance cannot be obtained simply from the powers associated with the incident and reflected waves. The second type of S-parameters is called the power wave scattering parameters. They are useful when one is interested in the power relation between microwave circuits connected through a junction. In this case, the magnitude of the reflection coefficient cannot exceed unity and the power delivered to the load is directly given by the difference between the powers associated with the incident and the reflected waves. Since this methodology deals with the reciprocal relations between powers from various devices this may be quite suitable for dealing with a pair of transmitting and receiving antennas where power reciprocity holds. This methodology is also applicable in network theory where the scattering matrix of a two port (or a multiport) can be defined using complex reference impedances at each of the ports without any transmission line being present, so that the characteristic impedances become irrelevant. Such a situation is typical in small signal microwave transistor amplifiers, where the analysis necessitates the use of complex reference impedances in order to study simultaneous matching and stability. However, for both the definition for the S-parameters, when the characteristic impedance or the reference impedance is complex, the scattering matrix does not need to be symmetric even if the network in question is reciprocal. The second objective is to illustrate that when the characteristic impedance of the line or the reference impedances in question is real and positive, then both of the pseudo-wave and the power-wave scattering parameters provide the same results. Finally, a general methodology with examples will be presented to illustrate how the S-parameters can be computed for an arbitrary network without any a priori knowledge of its characteristic impedance.},

  abstract = {In this paper it is explained how Maxwell's field equations together with the appropriate boundary conditions may be converted into equations analogous to those for coupled transmission lines. This makes it possible to use the well-known techniques of dealing with transmission lines to solve certain field problems in those cases in which either the method of separating the variables fails or the boundary conditions are too complicated for the conventional method. For example, this method may be applied to studying waveguide to horn junctions, bending of waveguides, propagation of waves over an imperfect earth in the vicinity of the source, etc. Other applications are suggested in the course of the paper. On the theoretical side, this conversion of field equations into transmission line equations brings together two heretofore independent theories of wave propagation on wires, namely, Lord Kelvin's theory based on circuit concepts and Kirchhoff's laws and Mie's theory based on field concepts and Maxwell's equations. The ``Generalized Telegraphist's Equations'' derived in this paper differ from Kelvin's classical Telegraphist's Equations in two respects. Firstly, for a pair of conductors Kelvin obtained one pair of differential equations implying the existence of only one mode of propagation. For the same pair of conductors we obtain an infinite set of equations implying an infinite number of modes, from which Kelvin's equations are obtained by neglecting the coupling between the principal mode and the higher order modes. Secondly, our equations for some transmission structures contain additional ``circuit parameters'' which do not appear in the classical equations. These parameters are of the same nature as those in the corresponding equations for waveguides of uniform cross-section with perfectly conducting walls and filled with heterogeneous dielectric medium. In the present case they arise from the boundaries of conductors rather from lack of homogeneity. The mathematics of converting Maxwell's Equations into Generalized Telegraphist's Equations is straightforward, although in the most general cases rather lengthy. The essential point is that a function, which for practical purposes is sufficiently arbitrary, may be represented in numerous ways by a series of orthogonal functions; and that when some such series are non-differentiable, the required relations between the coefficients of series representing the various field components may be obtained from Maxwell's equations by integration rather than by conventional substitution followed by differentiation.},

The value of 6, and E,,, can be used to derive EI. Furthermore, it is observed that in any material the elastic fraction of the secondary electrons exhibits a universal behaviour as a function of Ep. Fits to S(EJ and the energy distribution of the secondary electrons are proposed which can be used in Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {The results and interpretation of the modest-power (\textasciitilde{} 90 kW) lower-hybrid-heating experiment on Alcator A are presented. The expected results from linear waveguide-plasma coupling theory are outlined, and the possible effects of parametric instabilities, scattering from density fluctuations, and imperfect energetic ion confinement are addressed. It is found experimentally that good coupling and the absence of RF breakdown are achieved with a double waveguide array at available RF power densities P R F \^ 4 . 5 kW\#cnf2, the waveguide vacuum windows being outside the toroidal field magnets; a waveguide array having vacuum windows near the waveguide mouth so that the co = coce layer can be pressurized shows no breakdown at P R P {$>$} 8 kW/cm2 when a single waveguide is energized. Energetic ion production and a factor-of-50 increase in the fusion neutron rate are observed to take place at well defined values of central plasma density; below these densities electron heating occurs. The ion tail production is found to be independent of the relative phase of the double waveguide array employed. This ion heating occurs at a lower density than theoretically expected; together with the electron heating this indicates waves having rift\textemdash{} 5 being absorbed near the plasma centre. Probes at the plasma edge observe a frequency-down-shifted and broadened RF pump signal that is strongly attenuated as the plasma density increases through the neutron production band. These anomalous heating results and probe signals can be explained by a parametric decay of the pump wave into higher-nn lower hybrid waves near the plasma edge. An alternate qualitative explanation would be the poloidal scattering of the lower hybrid waves at the plasma periphery due to density fluctuations; the nn of the scattered lower hybrid waves would then increase as they propagated inward because of magnetic shear. The neutron rate decay times imply that the RF creates ion tails having a substantial fraction of their energy above 50 keV. The neutron decay times and rates strongly depend on plasma current and indicate the expected influence of ion confinement on RF heating efficiencies. Finally, the RF heating efficiencies are assessed.},

  abstract = {Metallic mirrors are to be used extensively within ITER for diagnostics and real time control. Erosion of the first wall within ITER will cause particles to be redeposited around the machine, including on these first mirrors, which will cause a reduction in reflectivity and a degradation in quality of signal received by the detectors. Powering these mirrors to form capacitively-coupled plasmas (CCPs) with an induced self bias, and using the ions within the plasmas to bombard and remove the deposits, has shown some experimental success in recovering mirror reflectivity. In this work the ion energy distribution functions (IEDFs) from an Ar CCP formed on a 5 cm radius metallic mirror are modelled and investigated using the hybrid plasma equipment model. Initially a geometry variation is done showing that a simple increase in reactor volume can significantly impact the spatial distribution of the ion flux to the mirror surface leading to non-uniform etch rates across the surface, even after the maximum bias has been achieved. The ion energies need to be sufficient to remove depositions (focussing on the first wall material of Be which forms a surface oxide BeO) but not subsequently damage the underlying mirror. In order to achieve this both the voltage (50\textendash 1000 V) and the frequency (13.56\textendash 60 MHz) have been varied within the model showing trends that may lead towards IEDF optimisation. The increase in voltage increases the self bias linearly and the plasma density super-linearly, whereas increasing the frequency barely effects the self bias while increasing the plasma density sub-linearly. Both increases cause an increase in ion flux for these reasons but both also decrease the homogeneity of the ion flux across the mirror surface which will be required should the energies be above the threshold for the mirror. These results are also unique to the geometry being investigated and thus the conclusion is that it would be prudent to model individual mirror geometries to find optimal parameters. This becomes especially clear with the introduction of a perpendicular magnetic field into the simulation that significantly reduces electron transport within the plasma.},

After more than 70 years of research, despite great progress, the goal has not been realized. Do you have to be crazy to love quests like this?

Through humorous anecdotes, and accessible yet detailed scientific discussion, this book illuminates the enjoyment of scientific research through an account of fifty years working on fusion energy development. The anecdotes bring out the human side of research, in which innovative and sometimes egocentric scientists create both clever and nutty experiments. Among the many stories within are witchcraft at Harwell, shocking experiences, entertaining talks, and the wit of top scientists such as Marshall Rosenbluth. Above all the book highlights the significant advances made in developing practical fusion energy and the promise for an exciting future with the National Ignition Facility and International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. This book will be of interest to physicists as well as other students and researchers in the scientific and wider communities. Shows the exciting and fun aspects of science research.

  abstract = {Secondary-electron-emission processes under electron bombardment play an important role in the performance of a variety of electron devices. While in some devices, the anode and the grid require materials that suppress the secondary-electron-generation process, the crossed-field amplifier (CFA) is an example where the cathode requires an efficient secondary-electron-emission material. Secondary-electron-emission processes will be discussed by a three-step process: penetration of the primary electrons, transmission of the secondary electrons through the material, and final escape of the secondary electrons over the vacuum barrier. The transmission of the secondary electrons is one of the critical factors in determining the magnitude of the secondary-electron yield. The wide band-gap in an insulator prevents low-energy secondary electrons from losing energy through electron-electron collisions, thereby resulting in a large escape depth for the secondary electrons and a large secondary-electron yield. In general, insulating materials have high secondary-electron yields, but a provision to supply some level of electrical conductivity is necessary in order to replenish the electrons lost in the secondary-electron-emission process. Our secondary-emission study of diamond demonstrates that the vacuum barrier height can have a strong effect on the total yield. The combined effect of a large escape depth of the secondary electrons and a low vacuum-barrier height is responsible for the extraordinarily high secondary-electron yields observed on hydrogen-terminated diamond samples.},

The IPB provided methodologies for projecting the performance of burning plasmas, developed largely through coordinated experimental, modelling and theoretical activities carried out on today's large tokamaks (ITER Physics R\&D). In the IPB, projections for ITER (1998 Design) were also presented. The IPB also pointed out some outstanding issues. These issues have been addressed by the Participant Teams of ITER (the European Union, Japan, Russia and the USA), for which International Tokamak Physics Activities (ITPA) provided a forum of scientists, focusing on open issues pointed out in the IPB. The new methodologies of projection and control are applied to ITER, which was redesigned under revised technical objectives. These analyses suggest that the achievement of Q {$>$} 10 in the inductive operation is feasible. Further, improved confinement and beta observed with low shear (= high {$\beta$}p = `hybrid') operation scenarios, if achieved in ITER, could provide attractive scenarios with high Q({$>$} 10), long pulse ({$>$}1000 s) operation with beta {$<$}no-wall limit and benign ELMs.},

The maximum plasma currents of 15 kA, 10 kA and 16 kA were achieved, respectively. The highest current drive figure of merit {$\eta$}CD {$\equiv$} neIpR/PRF was achieved by the CCC antenna. The efficiency of current drive should improve by reducing prompt orbit losses of high energy electrons by operating at higher plasma current (to improve orbit confinement) and higher toroidal magnetic field (to improve wave accessibility to the plasma core), while keeping the density high enough (to avoid excessive acceleration of electrons), but under the `density limit'.},

Good plasma coupling over a wide range of edge densities and a clean spectrum were predicted by an integrated model using TOPLHA and CST microwave studio, in which the antenna plasma coupling problem and the vacuum side EM problem were solved self-consistently. Poloidal variations of the edge density were found to affect mainly the evenness of power splitting in the poloidal direction. In order to characterize the coupling performance, LH2 is equipped with a variety of dedicated diagnostics such as 16 sets of RF probes, six Langmuir probes, and three X-mode reflectometer horns. LH2 was successfully commissioned in July 2010 including these dedicated diagnostics. The measured transmission loss is about 30 \% lower than the previous launcher and the clean spectrum has been confirmed. The power handling capability exceeding an empirical weak conditioning limit was demonstrated, and so far, the reliable operation upto 0.8 MW net LHCD power has been achieved.},

We explored the possibility of using a versatile FEM solver package, COMSOL, for lower hybrid (LH) wave simulation. Special care was paid to boundary conditions to satisfy toroidal symmetry. The non-trivial issue of introducing hot plasma effects was addressed by an iterative algorithm. These techniques are verified both analytically and numerically. In the lower hybrid (LH) grill antenna coupling problem, the FEM solver successfully reproduced the solution that was obtained analytically. Propagation of LH waves on the Alcator C and Alcator C-MOD plasmas was compared with a ray-tracing code, showing good consistency. The approach based on the FEM is computationally less intensive compared to spectral domain solvers, and more suitable for the simulation of larger device such as ITER.},

The primary motivation of this development is to extend the domain partitioning approach for incorporating arbitrarily shaped SOL plasmas and antenna to the TORIC core ICRF solver, which was previously demonstrated in the 2D geometry [S. Shiraiwa, et. al., ``HISTORIC: extending core ICRF wave simulation to include realistic SOL plasmas'', Nucl. Fusion in press], to larger and more complicated simulations by including a 3D realistic antenna and integrating RF rectified sheath potential model. Such an extension requires a scalable high fidelity 3D edge plasma wave simulation. We used the MFEM [http://mfem.org], open source scalable C++ finite element method library, and developed a Python wrapper for MFEM (PyMFEM), and then a radio frequency (RF) wave physics module in Python. This approach allows for building a physics layer rapidly, while separating the physics implementation being apart from the numerical FEM implementation. An interactive modeling interface was built on {$\pi$}Scope [S Shiraiwa, et. al. Fusion Eng. Des. 112, 835] to work with an RF simulation model in a complicated geometry.},

We partition the entire computation domain into two sub-domains: a core and an edge region. Simulations in each domain are performed separately with appropriate numerical solvers. For the core, the TORIC ICRF solver (Brambilla 1999 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 41 1) was modified to impose an essential (Dirichlet) boundary condition at its interface with the edge domain. In the edge, a finite element method is used to solve a cold collisional plasma model. The domains are then joined together using the continuity boundary condition for the tangential electric and magnetic fields at their interfaces (Hybrid Integration of SOL to TORIC: HIS-TORIC). The model developed here was tested using an ICRH H minority heating scenario on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak (Hutchinson et al 1994 Phys. Plasmas 1 1511). The simulated pattern of core wave propagation agrees well with a standard TORIC simulation. This approach opens the possibility of using a realistic diverted SOL plasma and a complicated 3D RF antenna together with a rigorous hot core plasma model, while requiring only minimal modification to existing RF codes.},

  abstract = {The International Tokamak Physics Activity topical group on integrated operational scenarios has compiled a database of stationary H-mode discharges at q 95 3 from AUG, C-Mod, DIII-D, JET and JT-60U, for both carbon wall and high-Z metal wall experiments with 3300 entries. The analyses focus on discharges that are stationary for {$\geqslant$}5 thermal energy confinement times to evaluate the baseline scenario proposed for ITER at 15 MA for achieving its goals of Q = 10, fusion power of 500 MW at normalised pressure, {$\beta$} N = 1.8 and normalised confinement as predicted by the standard H-mode scaling, H 98y2 = 1. With the data restricted to stationary H-modes at q 95 3, the database shows significant variation of thermal energy confinement compared to the standard H-mode scaling (IPB98(y,2)) in dimensionless form. The data show similar scaling with normalised gyro-radius, but more favourable scaling towards lower collision frequency and more favourable scaling with plasma beta. Using all the engineering variables employed in IPB98(y,2), results in an overfit due to correlations among the data. Moreover, there are significant residual trends in the confinement for plasma current, device size, loss power, and in particular for the plasma density. Significant differences between results obtained for devices with a carbon wall and high-Z metal wall are observed in the data, with data from carbon wall devices providing a larger operating space, encompassing ITER parameters or even exceeding them. H-modes in high-Z metal wall devices have, so-far, not accessed conditions at low collision frequencies, have lower normalised confinement (H 98y2 0.8\textendash 0.9) at low input power or beta, achieving H 98y2 1.0 only at input powers two times the L- to H-mode transition scaling predictions and at {$\beta$} N 2.0. Hence, only the best H-modes with high-Z metal walls reach ITER baseline performance requirements. The data show that operating at high plasma density, with line-averaged density at 85\% of Greenwald density is achievable for H 98y2 {$>$} 0.95 for a range of plasma configurations, and that operation at low plasma inductance with l i(3) 0.7\textendash 0.75 is feasible. Scenario simulations employed for projecting the plasma performance in ITER should incorporate a lower thermal confinement at low plasma beta for the entry to burn and provide projections using higher levels of plasma core radiation by plasma impurities. Moreover, ITER projections should not subtract the core radiation in the evaluation of the thermal confinement time and H 98y2, to allow a fair comparison with experimental data currently available. From the data presented here, it is likely that in ITER the energy confinement time will not increase with plasma density and will have no degradation with plasma beta. The analyses indicate that the data at q 95 3 are consistent with achievement of the ITER mission goals at 15 MA.},

  abstract = {"Preface to the Second Edition Since the publication of the first edition of this book there have been some very costly system failures, which could have been prevented with a better knowledge of electrical contact phenomena. I will give two examples. The first is an electrical connector that supplied power to the "Main Fuel Shut-off Valve" in the F-16 fighter airplane. This connector used tin plated pins plugged into a gold plated socket. As will be briefly discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, the failure of this combination from fretting corrosion in the aircraft's vibration environment caused the fuel to stop flowing to the jet engines. Several F-16 crashes are attributed to this connector failure with a subsequent cost of over \$100 M. In hindsight it is probable that this pin socket combination used extensively in the earlier F-111 airplane resulted in it cancellation. Failure of the connectors most probably resulted in this plane's performance changing from a "terrain following" aircraft to a "terrain impacting" one. The second example occurred in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which began its initial testing in September 2008. Soon after it began to operate, a connection to a 12 MVA transformer failed. This cut power to the main compressors that operated the cryogenic system for cooling the super conducting magnets in two sections. This failure caused extensive wiring damage that cost more than \$20 M to repair and set back the initial operation of this expensive experimental system by about nine months"--},

  abstract = {The thermal conductivity degradation due to low-temperature neutron irradiation is studied and quantified in terms of thermal resistance terms. Neutron irradiation is assumed to have no effect on umklapp scattering. A theoretical model is presented to quantify the relative phonon-scattering effectiveness of the three dominant defect types produced by neutron irradiation: point defects, dislocation loops and voids. Several commercial ceramics have been irradiated with fission reactor fast neutrons at low temperatures to produce defects. Materials include silicon carbide, sapphire, polycrystalline alumina, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride, beryllium oxide, and a carbon fiber composite. The neutron dose corresponded to 0.001 and 0.01 displacements per atom (dpa) for a \$60 \textdegree C irradiation and 0.01 and 0.1 dpa for a \$300 \textdegree C irradiation. Substantial thermal conductivity degradation occurred in all of the materials except BeO following irradiation at 60 \textdegree C to a dose of only 0.001 dpa. The data are discussed in terms of the effective increase in thermal resistance caused by the different irradiation conditions. Evidence for significant point defect mobility during irradiation at 60 and 300 \textdegree C was obtained for all of the ceramics. The thermal stability of the radiation defects was investigated by isochronal annealing up to 1050 \textdegree C.},

In the context of industrial design and optimisation of radomes, computation time is of primary importance. Therefore a new pragmatic approach to represent the radiated fields on a smaller set of conformal Gaussian beams is proposed. This new expansion does not use Gabor frames but is based on the physical properties of the configuration. Few numerical experiments are presented to evaluate its performances.},

The (2n)/sup 2/ T-parameters of the error network are explicitly expressed in blocks of n/sup 2/ at a time, as matricial functions of the 3n/sup 2/ S-parameters of three n-port standards, sequentially replacing the device under test during system calibration. The possibility has also been investigated of correcting the errors due to repeatable measurement-port mismatch changes, typical of switching scattering-parameter test sets.

The present work extends previous studies by using the input impedance (more precisely, the complex voltage reflection coefficient {$\Gamma$}) on each antenna port for comparison, instead of the more commonly used loading resistance or coupled power. The electron density profiles used for the simulation were reconstructed from the deuterium-carbon-nitrogen interferometer and lithium beam emission spectroscopy measurements, edge-localized mode-synchronized and averaged over time intervals from 10 to 200\,ms depending on the case; 112 cases were compared from seven ASDEX Upgrade discharges with widely different plasma parameters and two operating frequencies (30 and 36.5 MHz). Very good agreement in {$\mid\Gamma\mid$} was found with the measurements on antenna 3 ({$<$}3\% averaged over a shot), and good agreement was found with antennas 1 and 2 ({$<$}10\%); the code reproduced the correct trend in loading resistance RL in a significant majority of cases, although the discrepancies in the absolute values were rather high (up to\,\,{$\sim$}50\%) due to high reflection. Sources of discrepancy are discussed.},

Coupling is found to depend strongly on the value of the edge density, as well as the density gradient. The regimes, where one or the other of these parameters is important, are investigated. Typically, only the first few millimetres of the edge plasma are important in determining coupling. The major implications of the problem of coupling to an overdense plasma can be derived from a simple impedance-matching argument. In general, coupling is optimum for an edge density, n0, determined by , where nc = {$\omega$}2me/4{$\pi$}e2 and n{$\Vert$} is the parallel index of refraction of the lower hybrid wave.},

Experimental results from the 16-waveguide grill are compared with results from three other PLT grills with less sharply defined n| spectra. The current drive figure of merit, Ip\^R/P,\^ = 0.14 x 10l4 (A-cm\textasciitilde 3-m/W), is approximately 40\% higher for the experiments with the 16-waveguide coupler than for previously reported experiments on PLT, in spite of the larger 'spectral gap'.

The second is the exploitation of well-separated resonances of Alfv\'en waves inside the plasma-filled reactor cavity to greatly simplify the antenna structure. The large minor radius and high plasma density in TFTR-class and reactor tokamaks will accommodate fast-wave toroidal eigenmodes at frequencies which are well below all the cyclotron frequencies of ions of the fuel gas and of most impurities (carbon, oxygen, iron).

An astronomer with shared appointments in California and Maryland, the author ranges over a large portion of the universe as she discusses the search for life on other planets, how galaxies form, why stars explode and die, and the nature of the elusive dark matter in the universe. She also explains the astronomical significance of Cheeps' pyramid and leads the reader through scientific speculation about what and when the Star of Bethlehem might have been. Throughout, Trimble points to the exciting unanswered questions that still perplex the field and considers the formidable tasks to be faced by the next generation of young astronomers.},

  abstract = {A novel method for the calibration of a vector network analyzer (VNA) is presented where a through connection of the VNA test ports, two known high-reflective calibration elements serving as calibration standards, and a termination of arbitrary unknown reflection are required. The latter has to be connected to both ports and may, for example, be a low-reflective load or a flush short. If it is possible to connect the same known high-reflective element to both ports, the VNA is then calibrated by the use of only one known standard. As only one two-port connection, namely a through, is required, the new method is advantageous especially for measurements in waveguides at very high frequencies if we compare it with the well-known through-reflect-line (TRL) and line-reflect-line (LRL) calibration methods where two two-port connections, namely a through and a line (TRL) or two lines (LRL) are needed. Measurements of various low- and high-reflective devices under test (DUTs) in the WR-10 and WR-03 waveguide bands agreed well with TRL and LRL reference measurements, respectively. The influence of nonideal calibration elements or of reflection variations of the unknown termination on the S-parameter measurements of DUTs has also been theoretically and experimentally investigated.},

In this paper, SEE coefficients of alumina ceramics and sapphire coated with TiN films of various thicknesses are investigated. The SEE coefficients were measured using a scanning electron microscope with a single-pulse electron beam (100 pA, 1 ms). The SEE coefficients of TiN-coated alumina ceramics were lower than those of uncoated ones and nearly unity for TiN thickness of more than 1 nm, even with incident energy of 1 keV. To emulate multipactor-induced surface heating, the SEE coefficients were also measured at high temperature. The results showed a decrease in the SEE coefficients with temperature for TiN thickness of more than 0.5 nm. TiN coating on an rf window should be as thin as possible, and 0.5\textendash 1 nm may be the optimum thickness for suppressing multipactor.},

When it is used to experimentally determine the S-matrix of the system under different plasma conditions, pronounced asymmetries in the off-diagonal values of the S-matrix are seen. The S-matrix in the presence of plasma has been calculated with the RANT3D code using measured edge density profiles in front of the antenna; these agree remarkably well with the measurements. The asymmetry is caused primarily by the large pitch angle of the magnetic field in front of the antenna, coupled with the gradients in the plasma edge.},

  author = {Telang, Aviviere},
  year = {2009},
  month = may,
  abstract = {As modern satellite communication systems move toward multi-carrier high power communications, there is an increased need for high-power RF devices in the space industry. However, at high-power some RF devices have exhibited an electron plasma (multipactor electron avalanche discharge) that severely damages the RF device and could render it unusable. This is especially a problem in space where repairs to communication equipment is cost-prohibitive.  
As a result, a number of models have been developed in recent years to predict the onset of multipactor discharge. However, most existing models can only analyze selected geometries and they also require a large number of electrons to predict the power at which multipactor discharge will occur. This has placed a limitation on the types of RF structures that can be analysed for multipactor breakdown.  
This research work, uses a new generalized procedure to develop an efficient multipactor model that could be used to analyze the complex structures found in the commercial space industry, by coupling EM field information from established industry-standard EM solvers. A robust secondary emission model is also developed in order to model the advanced phenomenological characteristics of secondary emission that are not taken into account in other models. The result of the generalized approach taken in this research is a highly efficient multipactor model that requires far fewer electrons to be analysed in order to converge to accurate results, and the ability to analyse more complex RF structures than current models.  
Multipactor analysis for different structures were performed, and the breakdown results predicted by this model were in good agreement with other models where expected. However, for other cases where certain simplifying assumptions do not hold true, such as higher order waveguide multipaction and high impedance transmission line multipaction, results provided by this model were found to be more accurate and efficient when compared to other models.},

  abstract = {Launching of the fast wave in the lower hybrid frequency range is described. This wave is excited at the plasma edge by RF electric fields perpendicular to those required for the lower hybrid wave. In high-temperature plasmas, where the lower hybrid wave may not penetrate because of Landau damping or other effects near the edge, the fast wave might provide an alternative for heating and/or current generation in the central portion of the plasma. In addition, for high-density plasmas, this has the advantage that lower frequencies than those required for the lower hybrid excitation can be used. Thus waveguides of convenient dimensions for maximum power transmission and ease of fabrication can be employed. Coupling from a waveguide array into an inhomogeneous plasma is analysed. The model is infinite in y, the direction perpendicular to magnetic field and density gradient. Power reflection in the waveguides is found as a function of array design and density gradient at the edge. This reflection is fairly large ({$>$} 20\%). Propagation into the plasma is then considered, and the field structure and dispersion of the fast waves are found as functions of the distance of penetration. Unlike the lower hybrid waves, fast waves do not form resonance cones and energy is dispersed over a large volume.},

  abstract = {The non-linear coupling of lower hybrid waves excited by a waveguide array is examined numerically and analytically in a model of a tokamak plasma. The non-linearity considered is the ponderomotive force and the fields are evolved self-consistently in time to the steady state. Simplified coupling models are derived for the loading of large and small arrays and for different phasings of the waveguides. It is found that the reflection coefficient can be modified considerably by the non-linear effects and that the non-linear modification of the power spectrum is especially large when the array excites two resonance cones. The fields filament and the spectrum is broadened and upshifted. The travelling-wave excitation, which excites a single resonance cone and is considered for current drive, is less affected non-linearly; the fields do not filament and the spectrum remains narrow.},

Full account is taken of the modes excited inside the limiter frame and of their coupling to waves in the inhomogeneous plasma.

  abstract = {A general variational principle for an ICRF antenna radiating into a slab plasma is presented. The model is three-dimensional and includes the effect of connections to a transmission line. It also assumes an extent of absorption in the plasma that is sufficient to suppress eigenmodes. The variational principle gives the self-consistent currents flowing in the antenna, the fields excited inside the plasma and the antenna impedance at the generator terminals. Numerical computations are made for a TFR and a JET antenna. A study of power coupling shows that the optimum operating frequency lies near the plasma-modified resonance. The fields excited inside the plasma are found to disperse far more in the toroidal than in the poloidal direction. Also, at frequencies far from resonance, the large currents in the connections excite fields of considerably larger spatial extent than at resonance.},

A water-cooled window has two very important advantages; it employs a cheap and effective coolant and it is compact and probably more reliable than other solutions and thus can also be easily used as a torus window.

  abstract = {In many tokamak and stellarator experiments around the globe that are investigating energy production via controlled thermonuclear fusion, electron cyclotron heating and current drive (ECH\&CD) are used for plasma start-up, heating, non-inductive current drive and magnetohydrodynamic stability control. ECH will be the first auxiliary heating method used on ITER. Megawatt-class, continuous wave gyrotrons are employed as high-power millimeter (mm)-wave sources. The present review reports on the worldwide state-of-the-art of highpower gyrotrons. Their successful development during recent years changed ECH from a minor to a major heating method. After a general introduction of the various functions of ECH\&CD in fusion physics, especially for ITER, section 2 will explain the fast-wave gyrotron interaction principle. Section 3 discusses innovations on the components of modern long-pulse fusion gyrotrons (magnetron injection electron gun, beam tunnel, cavity, quasi-optical output coupler, synthetic diamond output window, single-stage depressed collector) and auxiliary components (superconducting magnets, gyrotron diagnostics, high-power calorimetric dummy loads). Section 4 deals with present megawatt-class gyrotrons for ITER, W7-X, LHD, EAST, KSTAR and JT-60SA, and also includes tubes for moderate pulse length machines such as ASDEX-U, DIII-D, HL-2A, TCV, QUEST and GAMMA-10. In section 5 the development of future advanced fusion gyrotrons is discussed. These are tubes with higher frequencies for DEMO, multi-frequency (multi-purpose) gyrotrons, stepwise frequency tunable tubes for plasma stabilization, injection-locked and coaxial-cavity multi-megawatt gyrotrons, as well as sub-THz gyrotrons for collective Thomson scattering. Efficiency enhancement via multi-stage depressed collectors, fast oscillation recovery methods and reliability, availability, maintainability and inspectability will be discussed at the end of this section.},

  abstract = {RF sheaths rectification can be the reason for operational limits for Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating systems via impurity production or excessive heat loads. To simulate this process in realistic geometry, the Self-consistent Sheaths and Waves for Ion Cyclotron Heating (SSWICH) code is a minimal set of coupled equations that computes self-consistently wave propagation and DC plasma biasing. The present version of its wave propagation module only deals with the Slow Wave assumed to be the source of RF sheath oscillations. However the ICRF power coupling to the plasma is due to the fast wave (FW). This paper proposes to replace this one wave equation module by a full wave module in either 2D or 3D as a first step towards integrated modelling of RF sheaths and wave coupling. Since the FW is propagative in the main plasma, Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) adapted for plasmas were implemented at the inner side of the simulation domain to absorb outgoing waves and tested numerically with tilted B0 in Cartesian geometry, by either rotating the cold magnetized plasma dielectric tensors in 2D or rotating the coordinate vector basis in 3D. The PML was further formulated in cylindrical coordinates to account for for the toroidal curvature of the plasma. Toroidal curvature itself does not seem to change much the coupling. A detailed 3D geometrical description of Tore Supra and ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) antennas was included in the coupling code. The full antenna structure was introduced, since its toroidal symmetry with respect to the septum plane is broken (FS bars, toroidal phasing, non-symmetrical structure). Reliable convergence has been obtained with the density profile up to the leading edge of antenna limiters. Parallel electric field maps have been obtained as an input for the present version of SSWICH.},

However, a nonuniform field may not only affect the results quantitatively, but may also lead to qualitatively new effects. In the present work, the effects of a nonuniform radiofrequency field on the properties of multipactor initiation are analyzed in the case of a cylindrical coaxial transmission line. A useful approximate solution of the nonlinear differential equation of motion for the electrons is derived and simple analytical estimates are developed to show that in this system the multipactor mechanism becomes qualitatively different for sufficiently small inner coaxial radii. When the inner radius is of the order of the outer one, the multipactor properties are very similar to those of its counterpart in plane-parallel geometry. However, when the inner radius is less than a certain threshold value, single-surface multipactor becomes possible.},

  abstract = {In view of improving ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) wave coupling in EAST (experimental advanced superconducting tokamak) necessary to obtain high-power discharges, two series of experiments in L-mode were devoted to the use of local gas injection as a tool to increase density in front of the antennas. During the first session, the quantity of deuterium simultaneously puffed from five different poloidal positions on each side of one ICRF antenna was gradually increased. Steady gas puffing on this antenna ( 8.1020 e s-1) increased antenna coupling resistance by 100\%, but puffing more gas did not provoke any further improvement. Plasma central electron density was not kept constant when using local puff but kept increasing during the discharges. During the second session, the global density was well-controlled and remained constant, the distance between the separatrix and the first wall was increased by 2 cm allowing, the gas to spread better, and puffing more gas this time lead to better wave coupling. The same amount of gas was then puffed from three different locations and changes in SOL (scrape-off layer) parameters were measured from several locations. Extensive analysis of the edge diagnostics made it possible to observe an electron density increase and a temperature decrease caused by the ionization of neutrals in the SOL. Heat loads on the divertor targets were slightly mitigated by gas injection, which is favorable from the perspective of long pulse scenario development. Injection at mid-plane led to the best results with the highest coupling simultaneously achieved for both antennas and smallest heat loads on the divertor target (below 1 MW m-2). As far as wave coupling efficiency is concerned, most experimental trends were also successfully reproduced by antenna modelling with the RAPLICASOL finite element code with experimental density profiles from reflectometry as the main input.},

Only the slow wave (SW) mode of ICRF waves can propagate and be studied in IShTAR. Therefore it is possible to decouple the role of the different ICRF modes in the RF sheath effects. Numerical simulations of the ICRF SW are done in COMSOL in the framework of the existing cold plasma modelling package RAPLICASOL and the SW is for the first time modelled in 3D. To date, RAPLICASOL existed as a 3D wave coupling modelling approach which targets the fast wave (FW). Plasma is implemented as a material with manually assigned physical properties and a perfectly matched layer (PML) is used to absorb the wave energy. Here it is demonstarted how to adjust the RAPLICASOL PML for models with propagating SW. Field structures in the resonance cone shape obtained for the SW differ significantly from the FW and exhibit strong dependence on the density profile in the close proximity of the antenna. The lower-hybrid (LH) resonance is a constant issue in the attempts to model the SW. In this work an approach to obtain correct numerical solutions in the LH resonance presence is demonstrated. Results of this work can be used to improve the complex tokamak ICRF simulations, where so far the SW propagation on the edge has been avoided.},

  abstract = {Heating and current drive in tokamaks with Lower Hybrid (LH) waves appears to generate hot spots magnetically connected to LH antennas. Correlated to these spurious patterns of heat deposition, fast electron populations are also reported experimentally. A Vlasov\textendash Poisson (1D, 1V) model is used to address this problem. External drive by waves with appropriate spectrum to describe the physics induced by LH antennas is considered. Fast electron tails, symmetric in velocity, are shown to build-up. In the range considered in this work, the energy content of these tails is found to be proportional to the energy of the excitation LH waves.},

It is shown that the accuracy requirements are quite severe for lower voltage impacts, up to about three times V/sub max/ (where V/sub max/ is the voltage at which the normal secondary emission ratio reaches its maximum value, delta /sub max/), but are less stringent above this range. A new formula for the low-voltage region, which agrees with experimental data better than the formula of R.G. Lye and A.J. Dekker (1957), is proposed. For the voltage region above 4 V/sub max/, the Lye and Dekker formula is retained, with a smooth transition centered between 3 and 4 V/sub max/. The directional effect is modeled by adjusting the values of delta /sub max/ and V/sub max/ before applying either formula, rather than applying either Bruining's or Muller's correction factor afterward. This results in an automatic modeling of the known absence of any appreciable directional effect below about half V/sub max/. Some experimental verification of the formula used to modify delta /sub max/ is presented.{$<>$}},

The object-oriented implementation of the algorithms is described, including an integral-form field solve, and a piecewisc current deposition and particle position update.

The system also allows one to probe the plasma column at the ordinary wave. It is proposed to use a combined mirror\textendash horn antenna system. Under conditions where there is limited space for placing horns, this results in a significant (up to 20 dB) increase in the signal, compared to the system of two horns considered earlier.

Such structures present metallic patterns at multiple scale levels and are viewed here as the superposition of multiple domains enclosed with appropriate boundary conditions. In each domain higher-order modes provide the accurate local description of the electromagnetic fields while lower-order modes are used to model the electromagnetic coupling between the various domains at large scales. The scale changing technique is applied here to the electromagnetic modeling of multifrequency selective surfaces and discrete self-similar (pre-fractal) scatterers. Experimental data are given for validation purpose. It is seen that the proposed technique is much better than the method of moments in time costing.},

New antennas are designed to operate in a load tolerant way which creates low impedance zones that are especially at risk since the existing VSWR protection systems are less sensitive to arcs in these areas. To protect these low impedance areas, a new arc protection system referred as scattering matrix arc detection (SMAD) has been proposed. This paper describes the basic operating principle and implementation in hard- and software for the JET ITER-like antenna (ILA), with testbed and preliminary JET commissioning results.},

The technical solutions chosen to drive the mechanical design are presented, in regard of the past experience on the 2007 TS prototype, together with the significant work carried out on the mechanical design to improve the launcher structure.

Bremsstrahlung emission from relativistic fast electrons in the core plasma drops suddenly above line averaged densities of 1020 m-3 ({$\omega$}/{$\omega$}LH {$\sim$} 3) in single null discharges with large ({$>$} 10 mm) plasma\textendash inner wall gaps, well below the density limit previously observed on limited tokamaks ({$\omega$}/{$\omega$}LH {$\sim$} 2). Modeling and experimental evidence suggest that the absence of LHCD driven fast electrons at high density may be due to parasitic collisional absorption in the scrape off layer. Experiments show that the population of fast electrons produced by LHCD at high density (n\textasciimacron e {$>$} m-3) can be increased significantly by operating with a plasma\textendash inner wall gap of less than {$\sim$} 5 mm with the strongest non-thermal emission in inner-wall limited plasmas. A change in plasma topology from single to double null produces a modest increase in non-thermal emission at high density. Increasing the electron temperature in the periphery of the plasma (0.8 {$>$} r/a {$>$} 1.0) also results in a modest increase in non-thermal electron emission above the density limit.},

  abstract = {Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) is an attractive option for non-inductive tokamak operation due to its high current drive efficiency and ability to drive current off axis. The parameters of the Alcator C-Mod LHCD system (f0 = 4.6 GHz, B{$\varphi$} 5.5 T, n\textasciimacron e 1020 m-3) are similar to the proposed LHCD system on ITER. This paper will describe improvements in LHCD technology on C-Mod designed to increase single-pass absorption at high n\textasciimacron e, extend pulse length (to {$>$}3 s), and increase power delivered to the plasma (to {$\sim$}2 MW). Modelling of lower hybrid (LH) wave propagation indicates that the observed loss of LHCD efficiency at higher n\textasciimacron e can be mitigated by enhancing the single pass power absorption through use of an off mid-plane launcher. The four rows of the launcher are located above the mid-plane (with Ip and B{$\varphi$} both clockwise viewing from the top down) in order to exploit the poloidal upshift of n as rays propagate from the antenna into the plasma. The transmitter protection system (TPS) was redesigned to model the coolant temperature in real time and shut off the klystron beam voltage if the coolant is close to boiling. The TPS upgrade has been installed and operated on C-Mod for pulses up to 4.5 s into dummy loads and 1.0 s into the plasma. A new movable local LH launcher protection limiter was designed to reduce reflection coefficients across a wide range of launcher positions. Finally, a high power waveguide double-stub tuner is under development to provide feedback controlled load matching to reduce power reflected from the antenna under poor coupling conditions.},

It utilizes two cylindrical vacuum barriers formed of an alumina ceramic. Two cylinders are coaxially disposed between tapered coaxial conductors to form a vacuum sealed connection between a pressurized coaxial transmission line and an ICRF antenna located within a vacuum chamber of KSTAR. A vacuum feedthrough is one of the most critical parts of an ICRF antenna. It must transmit RF power while keeping the antenna in high vacuum, and support antenna elements against electromagnetic forces and thermal stress. Frequently, high-power pulsed ICRF experiments have been limited due to breakdown at the vacuum feedthrough. In order to study a higher standoff capability, the vacuum feedthrough is tested and conditioned in the vacuum chamber with a high power RF test stand. A fast interlock circuit is also utilized to reduce breakdown energy. The amplitude of RF breakdown voltage of the conditioned vacuum feedthrough is measured to be {$\sim$}55 kV in the normal vacuum pressure of 1\textendash 5 \texttimes 10-5 mbar. The breakdown voltage is not changed severely up to 5 \texttimes{} 10-3 mbar. This paper will show the results of high power RF test and conditioning aiming for higher reliability at high RF power.},

The data can be used for impedance-matching points optimizing, as well as coupling coefficient assessment by deducing the antenna coupling resistance from antenna input impedance. The measurement error of amplitude and phase difference show distinct impact on the coupling resistance. Generally, the amplitude measurement error has a small impact on coupling resistance, while the phase measurement error significantly affects the coupling resistance. Instead of using phase detectors, phases can be extract from the power measurements. Thus, the antenna input impedance and coupling resistance can be deduced from the amplitude of voltage probe, amplitude of current probe, as well as the antenna feeding power. on previous experiments, the impedance measurement technique based on voltage probes array is utilized to evaluate coupling resistances. In EAST 2016 campaign, the load coupling resistance calculated by using such two techniques were detected and the results showed agreement.},

  abstract = {A helicon wave current drive is proposed as an efficient off-axis current drive in the high electron {$\beta$} plasmas that are expected in fusion reactors. A high frequency helicon wave coupling was analyzed using the surface impedance at a plasma boundary. A slow wave coupling, which may compete with the helicon wave coupling at a frequency of 500 MHz, is estimated to be lower than the fast wave coupling by an order of magnitude in the KSTAR edge plasma density and in practical Faraday shield misalignment with the magnetic pitch. A traveling wave antenna, which is a two port combline antenna, was analyzed using a simplified lumped element model. The results show that the traveling wave antenna provides load resiliency because of its insensitivity to loading resistance, provided that the loading resistance at a radiating element is limited within a practical range. The combline antenna is attractive because it does not require a matching system and exhibits a high selectivity of parallel refractive index. Based on the analysis, a seven element combline antenna was fabricated and installed at an off-mid-plane offset of 30\,cm from the mid-plane in KSTAR. The low power RF characteristics measured during several plasma discharges showed no evidence of slow wave coupling. This is consistent with the expectation made through the surface impedance analysis which predicted low slow wave coupling. The wave coupling to the plasma is easily controlled by a radial outer-gap control and gas puffing. No plasma confinement degradation was observed during the radial outer-gap control of up to 3\,cm in H-mode discharges. In a ELMy plasmas, only a small reflection peak was observed during a very short portion of the ELM bursting period. If the number of radiating elements is increased for high power operation, then complete load resiliency can be expected. A very large coupling can be problematic for maintaining a parallel refractive index, although this issue can be mitigated by increasing the number of elements.},

  abstract = {The calculus of differential forms has significant advantages over traditional methods as a tool for teaching electromagnetic (EM) field theory: First, forms clarify the relationship between field intensity and flux density, by providing distinct mathematical and graphical representations for the two types of fields. Second, Ampere's and Faraday's laws obtain graphical representations that are as intuitive as the representation of Gauss's law. Third, the vector Stokes theorem and the divergence theorem become special cases of a single relationship that is easier for the student to remember, apply, and visualize than their vector formulations. Fourth, computational simplifications result from the use of forms: derivatives are easier to employ in curvilinear coordinates, integration becomes more straightforward, and families of vector identities are replaced by algebraic rules. In this paper, EM theory and the calculus of differential forms are developed in parallel, from an elementary, conceptually oriented point of view using simple examples and intuitive motivations. We conclude that because of the power of the calculus of differential forms in conveying the fundamental concepts of EM theory, it provides an attractive and viable alternative to the use of vector analysis in teaching electromagnetic field theory.},

  abstract = {The behavior of electromagnetic fields in an inhomogeneous, anisotropic medium can be characterized by a tensor Green function for the electric field. In this dissertation, a new formalism for tensor Green functions using the calculus of differential forms is proposed. Using this formalism, the scalar Green function for isotropic media is generalized to an anisotropic, inhomogeneous medium. An integral equation is obtained relating this simpler Green function to the desired Green function for the electric field, generalizing the standard technique for construction of the Green function for the isotropic case from the scalar Green function. This treatment also leads to a new integral equation for the electric field which is a direct generalization of a standard free space result. For the special case of a biaxial medium, a paraxial approximation for the Green function is used to obtain the Gaussian beam solutions. A straightforward analysis breaks down for beams propagating along two singular directions, or optical axes, so these directions are investigated specially. The associated phenomenon of internal conical refraction is know to yield a circular intensity pattern with a dark ring in its center; this analysis predicts the appearence of additional dark rings in the pattern.},

We review the pedagogical aspects of the calculus of differential forms in providing distinct representations of field intensity and flux density, physically meaningful graphical representations for sources, fields, and fluxes, and a picture of the curl operation that is as simple and intuitive as that of the gradient and divergence. To further highlight the benefits of differential forms notation, we demonstrate the flexibility of the calculus of differential forms in responding to changes in the dimensionality of the underlying manifold on which the calculus is defined. We develop Maxwell's equations in the case of two space dimensions with time (2+1), and in a four-dimensional (4D or spacetime) representation with time included as a differential basis element on an equal footing with the spatial dimensions. The 2+1 case is commonly treated in textbooks using component notation, but we show that Maxwell's equations and the theorems and principles of electromagnetics can be expressed in a fundamentally two-dimensional formulation. In the 4D representation, graphical representations can be given to illustrate four-dimensional fields in a way that provides intuition into the interplay between the electric and magnetic fields in wave propagation. These results illustrate the usefulness of differential forms in providing the physical insight required for engineering applications of electromagnetics.},

The phonon scattering relaxation times for various scattering mechanisms have been analyzed in order to determine the effect each mechanism has on the lattice thermal conductivity of sapphire. The methods of calculation at low and high temperature are reviewed, and the results of these calculations are presented to compare the effect at different temperatures. It is found that vacancy scattering can significantly reduce the thermal conductivity over a wide temperature range; for example, a vacancy concentration of 0.01 per atom leads to a fractional change of about 90\% at 77 K versus 43\% at 400 K. This reduction has significance for the design and placement of radio frequency and microwave windows in fusion reactors.},

  abstract = {Non-inductive current drive by fast wave at very high ion cyclotron harmonics, known as `helicons' has the potential for high off-axis current drive efficiency compared with the other known non-inductive current drive techniques. However, non-inductive current drive by helicon wave has not been validated experimentally. To validate its anticipated performance experimentally, an antenna design is one of the most important issues. A Traveling wave antenna has particularly valuable features for launching the fast wave such as load resiliency, narrow n|| spectrum, and simple RF circuits without additional-external matching systems. Low power level helicon wave coupling experiments has been conducted successfully using a mock-up TWA in KSTAR. In the next step, in order to investigate a high power performance, a new prototype TWA based on the mock-up TWA has been designed, fabricated and measured for a medium power (100\textendash 300 kW) RF system. The prototype TWA having a Faraday shield was made of copper and consists of 10 current straps with 5 inch coaxial feeding lines as input and output ports. The detailed design parameters and electromagnetic characteristics of prototype TWA are discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a review of the electrical radio frequency measurement techniques used in glow discharge optical emission spectrometry (GD-OES). In the introduction we show that for accurate quantitative chemical measurements reproducible electrical measurements are necessary. In the main part we introduce the techniques to generate the radio frequency (RF) and to measure voltage, current and power of the RF discharges. The required bandwidth of a RF current probe is estimated. Directional couplers used for the power measurement are introduced and their properties and limits are discussed. An overview of the different numerical and electronic evaluation methods for the voltage, current and power signals is given. New electrical measurements at the start up of a RF discharge and of a microsecond pulsed RF discharge show the benefit of the glow discharge source with integrated voltage and current probes. We present the use of the evaluated parameters to describe the dependence of the sputtering rate and the optical emission on RF discharge voltage and current using the model of Boumans and Bengtson. We also discuss the techniques to measure thick insulating materials and thin insulating layers with RF-GD-OES. Especially the evaluation of discharge voltage and current is presented in detail.},

This paper describes the steps taken to develop the present geometry of the triplet pair Strap Housing Module from a thermal and structural perspective, and shows the critical areas of the structure. Key issues are the manufacturability, (achieved by HIPing - Hot Isostatic Pressing), the ability to handle the radiating plasma thermal flux of 0.35 MW/m{$^2$}, the RF losses and the neutronic radiation. HIPing is necessary to achieve the complicated system of cooling channels inside the structure, which divides the coolant equally in order to supply each strap in the triplet with 1 l/s of water. The components have also to withstand the strong mechanical forces generated by plasma disruptions affecting all internal structures and the elevated design cooling water pressure of 5MPa. In order to maximise reliability, joints between different materials in the cooling water system have been kept to a minimum. Therefore, in the interests of fabricability and availability, the whole structure is manufactured out of stainless steel (316L(N)IG). The low conductivity of 316L(N)IG demands small wall thicknesses to avoid hot spots; however this reduces the mechanical strength. Consequently an in depth FEM analysis is presented, which was used to find and to improve the critical aspects of this important component and was the best means of finding the optimum between thermal and mechanical performance.},

The analysis is based on the newly developed finite plane-wave series-expansion technique and the concept of the extended boundary condition. The combination of the two concepts greatly facilitates the modal analysis of complex boundary value problems and eliminates the numerical integration. The proposed modal analysis has been verified both by experiments and commercial software for a wide range of parameters. Design examples of I/O structures for a set of channel filters demonstrate the great value of the new modal analysis scheme in practical applications.},

Using a pair of two-strap antennas for comparison, the performance of a four-strap, fast wave antenna is assessed for a variety of configurations and antenna phases in Alcator C-Mod. To obtain robust voltage handling, the antenna was reconfigured to eliminate regions where the RF E-field is parallel to B or to reduce the RF E-field to {$<$}1.0 MV m-1. To limit impurity generation, BN tiles were used to replace the original Mo tiles, a BN clad septum was inserted to limit field line connection length, and BN\textendash metal interfaces were shielded from the plasma. With these modifications, the antenna heating efficiency and impurity generation are nearly identical to those of the two-strap antennas and independent of antenna phase in L-mode discharges. This antenna has achieved 11 MW m-2 in both heating and current drive phases in both L-mode and H-mode discharges.},

  abstract = {Impurity contamination and localized heat loads associated with ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) antenna operation are among the most challenging issues for ICRF utilization.. Another challenge is maintaining maximum coupled power through plasma variations including edge localized modes (ELMs) and confinement transitions. Here, we report on an experimental assessment of a field aligned (FA) antenna with respect to impurity contamination, impurity sources, RF enhanced heat flux and load tolerance. In addition, we compare the modification of the scrape of layer (SOL) plasma potential of the FA antenna to a conventional, toroidally aligned (TA) antenna, in order to explore the underlying physics governing impurity contamination linked to ICRF heating. The FA antenna is a 4-strap ICRF antenna where the current straps and antenna enclosure sides are perpendicular to and the Faraday screen rods are parallel to the total magnetic field. In principle, alignment with respect to the total magnetic field minimizes integrated E|| (electric field along a magnetic field line) via symmetry. Consistent with expectations, we observed that the impurity contamination and impurity source at the FA antenna are reduced compared to the TA antenna. In both L and H-mode discharges, the radiated power is 2030\% lower for a FA-antenna heated discharge than a discharge heated with the TA-antennas. Further we observe that the fraction of RF energy deposited upon the antenna is less than 0.4 \% of the total injected RF energy in dipole phasing. The total deposited energy increases significantly when the FA antenna is operated in monopole phasing. The FA antenna also exhibits an unexpected load tolerance for ELMs and confinement transitions compared to the TA antennas. However, inconsistent with expectations, we observe RF induced plasma potentials to be nearly identical for FA and TA antennas when operated in dipole phasing. In monopole phasing, the FA antenna has the highest plasma potentials and poor heating efficiency despite calculations indicating low integrated E||. In mode conversion heating scenario, no core waves were detected in the plasma core indicating poor wave penetration. For monopole phasing, simulations suggest the antenna spectrum is peaked at very short wavelength and full wave simulations show the short wavelength has poor wave penetration to the plasma core.},

  abstract = {The capacitively-coupled combline (CCC) antenna has been developed for current drive by the lower hybrid wave (LHW) on the TST-2 spherical tokamak. The combline antenna was developed to satisfy the requirements of high directionality, low reflectivity, and simple feeding. Since the combline antenna makes use of mutual coupling between neighboring elements, only the first and the last elements are connected to external feedlines. RF powers and power densities of the order of 100 kW and 1 MW m-2 can be achieved easily in small antennas of the order of 0.1 m2. The two CCC antennas installed in TST-2 (outboard-launch and top-launch) excite toroidal refractive index (n{$\varphi$}) spectra peaked around five with the frequency of 200 MHz. Wave excitation calculation using a finite element code shows that the excited power of the n{$\varphi$} = 5 LHW component increases rapidly when the plasma cutoff density layer (where ne = 5 \texttimes{} 1014 m-3) becomes closer than 27\,mm from the antenna surface, in agreement with experiment. Experimentally, the density profile in front of the antenna can be controlled by adjusting the side limiter location or antenna-plasma distance, and should be optimized for antenna-plasma coupling, since too high coupling results in a broadened and less directional n{$\varphi$} spectrum, and too low coupling results in a less efficient power coupling. Using these antennas, successful ST plasma start-up and Ip ramp-up to over 25 kA (about 1/4 of the nominal Ip for OH operation) have been achieved with RF power of less than 100 kW in about 40\,ms.},

Facing the plasma directly, the surface of the first mirrors could be sputtered by energetic particles or deposited with contaminants eroded from the first wall (tungsten and beryllium), which would result in the degradation of the reflectivity. The impurity deposits emphasize the necessity of the first mirror in situ cleaning for ITER. The mock-up first mirror system for ITER edge Thomson scattering diagnostics has been cleaned in EAST for the first time in a tokamak using radio frequency capacitively coupled plasma. The cleaning properties, namely the removal of contaminants and homogeneity of cleaning were investigated with molybdenum mirror insets (25\,mm diameter) located at five positions over the mock-up plate (center to edge) on which 10\,nm of aluminum oxide, used as beryllium proxy, were deposited. The cleaning efficiency was evaluated using energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, reflectivity measurements and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Using argon or neon plasma without magnetic field in the laboratory and with a 1.7 T magnetic field in the EAST tokamak, the aluminum oxide films were homogeneously removed. The full recovery of the mirrors' reflectivity was attained after cleaning in EAST with the magnetic field, and the cleaning efficiency was about 40 times higher than that without the magnetic field. All these results are promising for the plasma cleaning baseline scenario of ITER.},

By fuelling the plasma from gas injectors, placed as uniformly spaced array from top to bottom at each side limiter of the B-port antenna, which works in dipole phasing, the coupling resistance of the B-port antenna increased obviously. Furthermore, the coupling resistance of the I-port antenna was insensitive to a smaller rate of gas puffing but when the gas injection rate was more than a certain value ({$>$}1021s-1), a sharp increase in the coupling resistance of the I-port antenna occurred, which was mainly caused by the toroidal asymmetric boundary density arising from gas puffing.

The change in lattice parameter of AlN was also very little compared to the macroscopic length change. The a-axis expanded very slightly, whereas the c-axis contracted. The formation of a high density interstitial dislocation loop on the basal plane was observed.

We use the finite element analysis for macroscopic mechanical and electric simulations. It takes into account the setup geometry, elastoplastic mechanical behavior of contacting components in the finite-strain-plasticity framework and electrostatic properties. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the brass plastic behavior and to the thickness of coating layers is also performed. The finite element results are used for an asperity-based model, which includes elasto-plastic deformation of asperities and their mutual elastic interactions. This model enables us to simulate the real morphology of contact spots at the roughness scale using the experimentally measured surface topography. Finally, the Greenwood multi-spot model is used to estimate the electrical contact resistance. This three-level model yields results which are in good agreement with experimental measurements carried out in this study.},

  abstract = {Electron multipacting can cause breakdown in high RF power components like couplers and windows. The phenomenon starts if certain resonant conditions for electron trajectories are fulfilled and if the impacted surface has a secondary electron yield larger than one. A general cure against multipacting is to avoid the resonant conditions by a proper choice of the geometry. In many cases, however, it might not be possible to change the RF geometry sufficiently. Therefore, other methods are required to suppress multipacting, like grooving the surfaces or static electric and magnetic perturbations. In this paper, we investigate by numerical simulations the effect of a biasing DC voltage to multipacting in two special ceramic window geometries. Those are the DESY and FNAL cylindrical symmetric cold window designs of the TESLA input power coupler. We show that in both window designs multipacting can be avoided by choosing an appropriate biasing voltage. \# 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Close agreement has been found between the full EM modeling and the scaling of a single resonator or even prototype network analysis only. This procedure is expected to simplify the multipaction and ionization breakdown analysis of filters and filter-based diplexers and multiplexers.

  abstract = {Lower hybrid enhanced performance (LHEP) discharges have been successfully operated on Tore Supra, with a significant improvement in electron coreconfinement and remarkable steady-state features. However, recent attempts to operate such discharges with better confinement performance were hindered by the systematic onset of large MHD activity, preventing any good performance recovery. The associated MHD limit is found to result from reaching the tearing mode limit as the current profile is driven from centrally peaked towards off-axis peaked by the lower hybrid (LH) wave. The specific feature of the considered discharges is that they achieve a weak magnetic shear over a broader core region than past LHEP discharges, then leading to systematic fast MHD onset (m/n = 2/1 tearing mode) when qmin approaches 2. The present paper reports on experimental observations and modelling which support this finding and analyses the perspectives of improving the LHEP scenario by combining the current profile control through the LH wave with a significant increase in pressure through ion cyclotron wave coupling.},

Strong correlations between the triangularity of the magnetic equilibrium and both the grazing angle and the flux expansion are found by using linear regression.

However, the slow wave can be generated parasitically. The electric field of the slow wave can induce large biased plasma potential (DC potential) through sheath rectification. The rapid variation of the rectified potential across the equilibrium magnetic field can cause significant convective transport (E\,\,\texttimes\,\,B drifts) in the scrape-off layer (SOL). In order to understand this phenomenon and reproduce the experiments, 3D realistic simulations are carried out with the 3D edge plasma fluid and kinetic neutral code EMC3-Eirene in ASDEX Upgrade. For this, we have added the prescribed drift terms to the EMC3 equations and verified the 3D code results against the analytical ones in cylindrical geometry. The edge plasma potential derived from the experiments is used to calculate the drift velocities, which are then treated as input fields in the code to obtain the final density distributions. Our simulation results are in good agreement with the experiments.},

We simulated cases with gas puff in the lower divertor, the outer mid-plane and the top of the machine while keeping other conditions the same. Compared with the lower divertor gas puff, the outer mid-plane gas puff can increase the local density in front of the antennas most effectively, while a toroidally uniform but significantly smaller enhancement is found for the top gas puff.

To reproduce the experimental observations, to understand the associated physics and to optimize the gas puff methods, we have carried out three-dimensional (3D) simulations with the EMC3-EIRENE code in JET-ILW including a realistic description of the vessel geometry and the gas injection modules (GIMs) configuration. Various gas puffing methods have been investigated, in which the location of gas fueling is the only variable parameter. The simulation results are in quantitative agreement with the experimental measurements. They confirm that compared to divertor gas fueling, mid-plane gas puffing increases the SOL density most significantly but locally, while top gas puffing increases it uniformly in toroidal direction but to a lower degree. Moreover, the present analysis corroborates the experimental findings that combined gas puff scenarios\textemdash based on distributed main chamber gas puffing\textemdash can be effective in increasing the RF coupling for multiple antennas simultaneously. The results indicate that the spreading of the gas, the local ionization and the transport of the ionized gas along the magnetic field lines connecting the local gas cloud in front of the GIMs to the antennas are responsible for the enhanced SOL density and thus the larger RF coupling.},

The ICRF power coupling can be improved by increasing the SOL density locally in front of the antenna by means of local gas puffing/fueling. To understand the influence of local gas puffing on the SOL and ICRF coupling and to find the optimized gas valve positions to maximize ICRF coupling in ITER, the 3D SOL code EMC3-EIRENE is used to calculate the SOL density, and the ICRF antenna codes ANTITER and FELICE are then used to calculate the coupling resistances. Purely deuterium plasma is simulated and the total gas puff rate for all studied cases is 4.5e22 el/s. The divertor gas puffing case is considered as the reference case. The density and temperature profiles in the reference case are well fitted to the standard ITER profiles (both for the low and medium density) with proper transport parameter profiles. The gas source is then switched to other local positions of the main chamber while all other simulation parameters are kept the same. The simulation results indicate that midplane gas puffing increases the antenna coupling resistance most significantly (by 150\%-200\%) for both ICRF antennas. This increase is at the same level as long as the gas valve is located toroidally close to the antenna, no matter if the gas valve is right to or left to the antenna. Outer top gas puffing increases the coupling resistance less significantly (by 100\%\textendash 150\%) for the antenna with good magnetic field line connections to the gas valve, but the increase is at a much smaller level (by {$\sim$}30\%\textendash 60\%) for the other antenna with only partial field line connections to the valve. The simulations thus confirm for ITER a behavior similar as seen experimentally in current devices and strongly suggest that ITER should modify the existing main chamber injection configuration to bring one of the four planned injection points closer to the antennas.},

  abstract = {When radio-frequency waves propagate through magnetized plasmas, they scatter at density filaments, which are usually aligned with the magnetic field lines. We show that this scattering can redirect part of the power from the perpendicular direction to the parallel direction (along the field lines, along the filament). In magnetic confinement fusion devices, such as tokamaks, plasma is often heated by Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequency (ICRF) antennas. For such antennas, our simulations show that a parallel Poynting flux in the level of 1 MW/m2 can be generated by this power redirection mechanism. The increase of the magnitude of electric and magnetic fields of the wave in the filament is responsible for the parallel redirection of power flow. Simulations with constant density in the filament and background plasma show that the dominant parallel wavenumbers of the power spectrum in the filament are increased and additional wavenumbers can be generated. In the cases with an experimental density profile, only the power spectrum in the filament is significantly affected while the rest part is almost the same.},

  abstract = {Sufficiently high voltage applied between two metal electrodes, even in ultra high vacuum conditions, results in an inevitable discharge that lights up the entire gap, opening a conductive channel through the vacuum and parasitically consuming large amounts of energy. Despite many efforts to understand the processes that lead to this phenomenon, known as vacuum arc, there is still no consensus regarding the role of each electrode in the evolution of such a momentous process as lightning. Employing a high-speed camera, we capture the entire lightning process step-by-step with a nanosecond resolution and find which of the two electrodes holds the main responsibility for igniting the arc. The light that gradually expands from the positively charged electrode (anode), often is assumed to play the main role in the formation of a vacuum arc. However, both the nanosecond-resolution images of vacuum arc evolution and the corresponding theoretical calculations agree that the conductive channel between the electrodes is built in the form of cathodic plasma long before any significant activity develops in the anode. We show evidently that the anode illumination is weaker and plays a minor role in igniting and maintaining the conductive channel.},

  abstract = {The unirradiated tensile properties for several different heats and thermomechanical treatment conditions of precipitation strengthened Hycon 3HP\texttrademark{} CuNiBe (Cu\textendash 2\%Ni\textendash 0.35\%Be in wt.\%) have been measured over the temperature range of 20\textendash 500 \textdegree C for longitudinal and long transverse orientations. The room temperature electrical conductivity has also been measured for several heats, and the precipitate microstructure was characterized using transmission electron microscopy. The CuNiBe alloys exhibit very good combination of strength and conductivity at room temperature, with yield strengths of 630\textendash 725 MPa and electrical conductivities of 65\textendash 72\% International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS). The strength remained relatively high at all test temperatures, with yield strengths of 420\textendash 520 MPa at 500 \textdegree C. However, low levels of ductility ({$<$}5\% uniform elongation) were observed at test temperatures above 200\textendash 250 \textdegree C, due to flow localization near grain boundaries (exacerbated by having only 10\textendash 20 grains across the gage thickness of the miniaturized sheet tensile specimens). Scanning electron microscopy observation of the fracture surfaces found a transition from ductile transgranular to ductile intergranular fracture with increasing test temperature. Fission neutron irradiation to a dose of \$0.7 displacements per atom (dpa) at temperatures between 100 and 240 \textdegree C produced a slight increase in strength and a significant decrease in ductility. The measured tensile elongation after irradiation increased with increasing irradiation temperature, with a uniform elongation of \$3.3\% observed at 240 \textdegree C. The electrical conductivity decreased slightly following irradiation, due to the presence of defect clusters and Ni, Zn, Co transmutation products. Considering also previously published fracture toughness data, this indicates that CuNiBe alloys have irradiated tensile and electrical properties comparable or superior to CuCrZr and oxide dispersion strengthened copper at temperatures {$<$}250 \textdegree C, and may be an attractive candidate for certain lowtemperature fusion energy structural applications. Conversely, CuNiBe may not be preferred at intermediate temperatures of 250\textendash 500 \textdegree C due to the poor ductility and fracture toughness of CuNiBe alloys at temperatures P250 \textdegree C. The potential deformation mechanisms responsible for the transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture are discussed. The possible implications for other precipitation-hardened alloys such as nickel based superalloys are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The last five years have witnessed remarkable progress in the theory and measurement of both the radiation and impedance properties of antennas in plasmas. Increased motivation for research in this area has been provided by the Space Shuttle program and by the prospect of nuclear fusion. The focus of attention has been on resonance cones" in linear, anisotropic plasmas, including radiation patterns, wave interference, pulse propagation, reflections from boundaries and inhomogeneous media effects. Under nonlinear conditions, the focussed field of a resonance cone can significantly depress the plasma density. Under both linear and nonlinear conditions, the input impedance of dipole and loop antennas has been studied extensively, for both anisotropic and isotropic plasmas. A continuing challenge has been the as-yet-not-fully-explained experimental observation of linear, non-eollisional enhanced resistivity of the sheath region around an antenna. Numerical impedance calculations employing simplified velocity distributions have shown particular promise. Ion and electron wave radiation patterns for various antenna shapes have been calculated and checked experimentally. The response of both single antennas and pairs of antennas to plasma fluctuations has been studied and found to have applications to plasma diagnostics.},
